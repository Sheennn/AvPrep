Question Number: AT00001
- Name: Alsanafi
  Comment: I like to solve it Step by step :

1) Fuel difference = 360-241=119

2) ETO difference = 18:52-19:45=53min
Fuel/Time = 119/(53/60)=134.7 kg/h

3) ATO difference= 18:52-19:42=50min
Fuel Time= 119/(50/60)=142.8 kg/h

4) Fuel consumption difference = 142.8-134.7=8.1kg/h

  Comment: same amount of fuel, in shorter amount of time
-> fuel ratio increases

good luck ;)

  Comment: From a mathematics point of view, this is exactly like asking : you're at this position and it's 12:00pm, what's your speed?
I might need an initial time and position to tell you how fast I'm going...
- Name: BennyB
  Comment: IMO theres not enough info to categorically say the consumption is higher with only the one actual fuel check figure, theres some big assumption being made no? Question No 337587 is a perfect example of this, and actually has exactly the same figures as this annex, where the fuel consumption actually remains the same and the GS is higher than planned, so they burn less total fuel, but the consumption is the same. Also for this question, you can't really assume that they will have 15kg less again at the waypoint because the GS is clearly different to planned if you look at the ETO vs ATO. Surely this is an appealable question?

  Comment: Hello @TopGun81, thank you for your feedback. The question you are referring to is similar to question 337587 in our database. Please check this question and compare it with the one you encountered in the official exam.
- Name: AntonB
  Comment: The logic behind the "correct" answer to this question is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing in the question indicates that we fly at a higher speed or lower altitude than planned, so the only reason as to why we arrive at TORDU earlier than planned is that we have a stronger tailwind than expected. The wind is the only factor we don't control. Our TAS and altitude remain unchanged, thus our fuel flow is also unchanged but our GS is higher than planned, therefore our actual fuel consumption must be lower than planned!
- Name: Ianmchale
  Comment: 360-241=119 kg
Estimated takes 53 minutes therefore 119/53 x 60=134.7
Actual takes 50 minutes therefore 119 / 50 x 60=142.8
142.8-134.7=8.1kg

  Comment: @robinrooster what do you mean?
- Name: klappan
  Comment: One of the most difficult questions in the entire DB. You need to assume an identical fuel consumption of planned vs. actual (119 kg) between TOC and TORDU, but nothing in the question gives a clue about this. You simply need to know it to solve the Q, then it's easy.
- Name: robinrooster
  Comment: giVen fuel -> V = 5kg
not given -> 8kg
- Name: TB20Sam
  Comment: This question is ridiculous. It's basically expecting us (without telling us) to assume that the fuel consumption per unit ground distance is exactly the same as planned, despite the fact that we're travelling at a faster groundspeed than planned and our fuel burn on the flight so far has been less than planned. This is unrealistic and not how fuel planning and monitoring works in the real world.

In the real world you would do another fuel check at SOPET or TORDU and calculate the actual fuel consumption from that. Not guess it based on pie-in-the-sky imaginary assumptions.

What's the point of even asking a question like this; what are they hoping that we learn from it?
- Name: Manjitha
  Comment: Do planned fuel and actual fuel burn.

1. planned fuel burn 360 - 241 = 119 in 53 minutes , in 60 minutes --> 53/119 X 60 = 134.7
2.Actual fuel burn is 15 kgs less that is given at top of climb 375 compared to planned 360 (375-360 = 15 )

Therefore actual fuel left at TORDU 241 + 15 = 256 kgs and fuel burned in 50 minutes (19:42 - 18:42) is 119

Actual fuel consumption 119 / 50 X 60 = 142.8

Fuel left 142.8 - 134.7 = 8.1
- Name: Anezka
  Comment: These questions should be easy ones but for some reason I keep struggling to solve them correctly. So I am giving up:
3 Q about TORDU in the database.

TORDU at 19:42 -> 263 kg
TORDU with 1 figure in Fuel Check column -> 8kg/h higher
TORDU with 2 figures in Fuel Check column -> 5kg/h higher
- Name: SHOKS
  Comment: U consume same fuel but reach 3 minute earlier hence u have consumed an extra 3 min of fuel which amounts to approx 7.1 kg of fuel in 50 min. That is about an 8 kg per hour extra fuel consumption rate.
- Name: Fern14
  Comment: Agree with Erich that to compare actual and plan fuel, you need at least two actual fuel values to compare. Without that, you can try the smartest calculation, it is wrong no matter what. This question is terrible, on top of being inaccurate in its solution logic. Your questions bank is very good in general, but be careful what you try to teach to young pilots. I am doing those exams to convert FAAto EASA, and those type of questions with unrealistic explanations should be avoided. Other than that, great job.
- Name: P210N
  Comment: We start with 15 kg more fuel then planed in the race and have obviously a higher Groundspeed, less airtime and thus less consumption. No way the actual consumption can be 8,1 higher than the panned - one do not need a calculator to see this, as long as there no hint, that the poweer setting has changed in between and we are now burning more fuel.
- Name: NADER
  Comment: Over toc we have extera 15kg of fuel so IF we arrive at each point at exact ETO we should end up having +15kg of fuel.
But we arrive over Sopet and Tordu at earlier times , which means we are faster.
For simplicity forget the +15kg as it is confusing.
Between TOC and Tordu according to ETO(53min) and PLANING FUEL REMAINING (119kg) we should burn 134.7kg/hr.
BUT
According to ATO we are faster and are burning 119kg in 50min which is a fuel burn of 142.8kg/hr

142.8 - 134.7 =8.1 kg

Its a bit confusing but you can memorize it this way to pass the test !
- Name: SyedAta
  Comment: in Q No 337587 almost same condition and fuel was saved by 7 Kg, how the consumption could be more right in the next question without change of values ? please reply
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @SyedAta, thank you for your comment. In question 337587, fuel calculation was based on the planned fuel flow instead of the actual fuel flow as stated in the text of this question. That is;
Fuel flow = (Planned fuel remaining at ToC - Planned fuel remaining at TORDU) / Planned flight time from ToC to TORDU = [(360 kg - 241 kg) / 53] x 60 = 135 kg/hr.
In question 335104, the actual fuel flow was compared with the planned fuel flow and here the planned fuel flow is also the same as the question 337587.
As a result, fuel consumption varies depending on whether the fuel flow used in the fuel calculation is actual or planned.
- Name: jonathonjames
  Comment: Ive seen a few interesting comments here that it isnt solvable, I solved it but in a different manner to the explanation:

The expected fuel burn between TOC and TORDU is 119 in 53 minutes giving a fuel burn of 2.245kg/min.
The actual time between TOC and TORDU is 50 minutes, giving 112kg at the same rate of burn as above.

The difference between them is about 7kg, (plus / minus a few decimal points) however if we look at the fuel at TOC it is 15kg higher than expected, so add the 15 back on: we get 127kg. 127-119 = 8kg more than we expected to have.

I have no idea whether this is the correct method, but mathematically it makes sense and it did get me the correct answer.. .. ..

  Comment: If we somehow end up with more fuel than planned we are burning more fuel ?
- Name: Mrspoun
  Comment: This question is really nonsense, if the fuel flow is different we cannot simply assume that the difference btw planned and actual remains 15 kg?!
- Name: GhaithGarraoui
  Comment: Those 15 kg could be gained in a 10 minute, 15 minute, 20 minute climb, etc. How can we suppose the aircraft hasn't gain even more in the cruise between TOD and TORDU when we don't have the fuel check figure at TORDU?
- Name: chesl
  Comment: how is it possible to assume that we will have the same extra 15 kg at TORDU if our flight time and conditions (eg GS, wind cond, whatever) are different? it is vague as hell! god help us
- Name: Spaceman
  Comment: In this one it is 8kg/h as the do not give you the information about how much fuel you have used.

There is another similar one where it is 5kg/h and they give you the fuel information.

Helps if you are short on time. Good luck!
- Name: Anaaaaa
  Comment: so far ive seen 2 types of this question:
- there is a given value of fuel check at TORDU = 5kg/h higher than planned
- there is NO given value for fuel check at TORDU = 8kg/h higher than planned
- Name: rmocholi
  Comment: I had the question 337587 just before this one. It asks the actual fuel remaining whith the same exact annex. I tried to extract it with the method of this question and it were wrong, now i use the method of that question on this one and it's wrong. There the correct answer for the same thing (Fuel remaining at TORDU) is 263kg and here is 256. If there is no consistency between the methods i would use in every case i don't know what tf im studying, it feels more like a lottery than an evaluation of knowledge.

- Name: cskpe
  Comment: Anac today, diff values, and there was a fuel check on 3rd line.

the 375 fuel check, minus the value on the 3rd check, would give the same amout of used fuel as per the planned.
on the flying there was just 15L more of fuel on the tanks. both would be 119 less than the first line

I've contested it arguing that it's not specified if the 'planned fuel consumption' they mention is just for the fisrt 3 legs, or for the whole flight.

for the first 3 legs, no change, for the whole flight it would've raised..
- Name: Nikko
  Comment: So, how do you calculate actual fuel consumption without any actual fuel figures for the leg in question? Maybe this is just another case of a really badly worded question - shouldnt the question be asking what the replanned fuel consumption is rather than actual consumption? With the only ACTUAL figure being the fuel check after the climb, there is absolutely no information about actual cruise consumption, which is what you would need in order to answer this question. Am I missing something?

  Comment: I had this question at Austro NL today BUT there was now a value written down for the fuel at TORDU: 258 kg. And that made the correct answer 5 kg/h more.
- Name: Czajnik
  Comment: @Michael you are just guessing that you burned 119kg of fuel in 50 minutes. There is no clue in the question/annex to confirm this.
- Name: Michael
  Comment: Got it first try, here is how: Planned FF = 119 kg / 53 min = 135 kg/hr.
Actual FF = 119 kg/50 min = 142.8 kg/hr - 135 kg/hr = 8 kg/hr higher.
- Name: Maverickopoulos
  Comment: This should not even be solvable with the provided data. Why are we here assuming random numbers. (Yes, assuming you will still burn 119 kg without any reason/evidence is random)
- Name: PedroL FINISHEDATPL
  Comment: 119 * 60 / 53 = 134.7
119 * 60 / 50 = 142.8

142.8 - 134.7 = 8.1kg/h higher
= 167 GS needed to reach 3 minutes earlier at TORDU, the aircraft consumed more fuel, which, in fact, TAS remains constant as it doesn't vary with change in wind, but GS does. Might some info in the table be wrong? Assuming you can't have an increase in fuel flow without changing GS (with TAS constant)

Cheers
- Name: Jifi68
  Comment: I think that there is a problem. So according to the plan we should have taken 53 min and consume 119kg of fuel to fly the leg.
During the actual flight, we only took 50 min to fly the leg, but no fuel check has been done at TORDU, so how can we assume that we also consume 119kg of fuel ?? Maybe we consume more fuel, or may be less fuel. Or maybe we just flew faster because of tailwind with the same fuel consumption ?

What I want to say is, without a real fuel check, we don't know how many fuel we still have in the tank at TORDU, so we can't calculate a consumption.
Are you sure that the annex is complete ?
- Name: Putinisaknob
  Comment: This awful question has me confused on two points. One, how are we able to assume that whilst we used less fuel than intended on the first leg, the rest of the legs will go to plan. And secondly, if it has actually used less fuel on the first leg, how does the answer come out that we end up using more fuel than intended?
- Name: Sam
  Comment: Had this on 24/4/23 UK CAA, there was an additional '258kg' stated in the AFOB for TORDU which meant the calculation came out to roughly +5kg/h higher than planned
- Name: Thomas
  Comment: Seen in Sweden 22/04/23.

Different numbers. The correct answer was 5kg higher.
- Name: Usamakhan
  Comment: How can you just -magically- assume that the fuel consumed is always 15 kg less. One way only, Id assume that throughout the journey it has used 15 kg less, and somehow the consumption becomes higher.
Lets just disregard the entire journey, right?.

One thing we all can agree upon for sure, the CAA exam creators are either drunk or high 24/7.

- Name: NeilAquilina
  Comment: In the first 8 minutes you burnt 15 kg LESS than expected and somehow we have a higher fuel consumption per hour.
- Name: Livia
  Comment: @atplq got this in my exam Rome, Italy 22.02.2023
In the annex the fuel check at Tordu was already given and it was 258kg, so the fuel flow was 140kg/hr and the difference between the planned consumption(135kg/hr) was 5kg/hr higher . I assume that was the correct answer.
- Name: Hannes
  Comment: You can't assume that the fuel consumed from TOC to TORDU stays the same if the ATO's change. Of course the fuel consumption per hour will be higher if you consume the fuel in less time. The question makes no sense.
- Name: Ferdiwagner
  Comment: What the explanation does it is assumes same fuel consumed per NGM as planned, but we have no reason to believe that to be true, since it obviously was not up to our only fuel check.
What i would do here is assume the leg to TOC is our only leg so far, and we have used 15kg less fuel than planned up to this point.
It has taken us 8 minutes to get here, so 15kg less than planned per 8 minutes, which is 112.5kg/h less than planned.
The answer is obviously extremely high, but without a second fuel check i have no idea how else one would calculate it.
Let's just hope we have a second fuel check on exam, as some people have commented.
- Name: Radoslaw
  Comment: where is logic again ? Why you point out that we have used 15 kg less at the beginning if you dont use in calculations later? Its non essential information then and misleading. You simply took same fuel burn and calculated for 50 and 53 minutes of trip. Why you confuse us ?
- Name: Marcelo
  Comment: So we just need to *assume* that the amount of fuel consumed in that distance (119 Kg) will be the same, despite having consumed 15 Kg less than expected until TOC. Very poor question indeed.
- Name: mariamaria
  Comment: 360-241=119 kg
ETO: 53min => 119:53x60=134.7
ATO: 50min => 119:50x60=142.8

142.8-134.7=8.1kg
- Name: UNCLEPIP
  Comment: Yesterday I had this question in UK CAA with the exact same wording but they gave the actual fuel remaining at tordu which I remember roughly about 215 remaining. That figure most likely wont be right but its a guess.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi guys, the current correct option has been confirmed by students. The explanation translates how we assume EASA solved this exercise. Unfortunately, there is no link between us and the authority, so there is no way we can refute this question. All we can suggest is that you leave a comment explaining why you do not agree with it.
In the meantime, we would highly appreciate any further feedback.
- Name: Camelia
  Comment: @ATPL Q : the question asks about the fuel consumption, and in the answers we have fuel flows. This is unexpected. You then consider, in the calculation, that the fuel consumption remains the same from TOC to TORDU, as you consider that we still have 15kg extra when reaching TORDU. Nowhere it is stated that we have the same consumption, this is a huge assumption. And by using the same fuel consumption, you actually answer the question. Could you please check the wording? And whether the actual fuel check wasnt provided, because this is a very unclear question making us make a big assumption based on no information provided !
- Name: Michael
  Comment: @ATPLQ I cant follow your calculation. The first fuel check indicates that we burned 15 less than planned. So how comes that we burn more fuel than planned in the end?
- Name: Erich
  Comment: @ATPLQ I understand how you worked this out.. but really, one fuel check at ToC is really not how you work out average fuel flow. You need at least one more fuel check after that at cruise conditions to get any real idea of what's going on
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS

  Comment: Distance to PET= D x H/ O+H, you can remember the distance as: Distance to PET the dog( DHOH) like in an Dutch accent
Distance to pet is required for the Time to PET calculation.
Time to PET= Distance to pet/ O(GS out)

Distwnce to PSR= Endurance x O x H/ O+H ( you can remember it like someone calling your attention ( EOH) then O+H
Distance to PSR is required for the Time to Psr calculation
psr= e+h/o+h ( the same as the distance to pet, but just swap the d(distance) for e(endurance)

  Comment: I think u got it exactly opposite of what it is

Flight plan endurance is without reserves because that is when ur tanks run dry and SAR is launched

  Comment: How to remember: PSR = POINT OF SAFE RETURN. It is not safe if we return with no reserves intact, so pick reserves intact option. Now, PSR is not POINT OF EQUAL TIME so do not pick the option that has something to do with EQUAL TIME. rest to remember is, return back to dest, alt or dep.
- Name: Marlboro
  Comment: @bozhidar, .wind is a factor. If you have equal flight time in the air, but a strong headwind back to departure, you may fly for 1hr, but cover a small distance. Based on GS out, home, we establish a point where sufficient fuel is there to either return or proceed to destination.
- Name: George
  Comment: It wouldn't be a safe return if you had no fuel upon arrival. Also not in the same time, that is associated with the Point of Equal Time. Use process of elimination.

  Comment: IAA today but heavily reworded.
Something similar to what Mayahuel298 described below. In my case I had a route from one coordinates to another (flying westwards but not enough info provided to find out an actual track) and the wind changed from something like 295/60 to 225/60 (not sure about exact values).

I had 3 Qs in my exam about FMC. Unfortunately I cant find them in the bank.
Exam was around 50% Irish bank, only few questions that I havent seen before, the rest was ok, just different numbers but same principles. Its passable but I recommend to do full bank, not only the Irish one.
- Name: Daffy
  Comment: At the same CI speed increases, but not necessarily to maintain ETAs. Its about performance and range.
- Name: FlyingLegend
  Comment: This would increase our cost index, that we set before the flight, it just doesn's make any sense. The FMS would suggest a different optimum flight level and calculate a different ETA

Please see our previous comment for detailed information on wind input into the FMS. Thank you for your comment.
- Name: Pipinho
  Comment: None of the options here are 100 correct
Id appeal. And if it appears on the exam just think about performance when we are suppose to increase speed for a headwind

  Comment: Greetings everyone! I greatly appreciate all of your comments and feedback. As a Boeing 737 pilot myself, I must admit that I have some reservations about the currently accepted correct option. However, it has been reported by students that this answer was deemed correct in their exams. In such cases, I would encourage you to challenge this question if you encounter it in your own examinations.
Now, let's discuss the behavior of the Flight Management System (FMS) when there is a variance between the actual wind and the wind entered into the FMS:
If the FMS detects a difference in wind, it will calculate a new optimal speed based on the updated wind data and the entered cost index. However, this adjustment is applicable only when the VNAV mode is set to ECON. If a fixed speed is selected, the FMS will continue flying at that speed regardless of the wind conditions. In such cases, the FMS will continuously recalculate the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) based on the current time, position, actual wind for the current leg, and inserted winds for other legs.
Most FMS systems provide a feature that allows pilots to reach a specific waypoint at a predetermined ETA. When this mode is activated, the FMS will continuously recalculate and adjust the speed to achieve the desired ETA at the specified waypoint. It's worth noting that this mode is not a standard operating mode.
Thank you once again for your valuable contributions!

  Comment: I fly the 737-800, I can tell you the "correct" answer is wrong. It does not work like this. FMC will maintain the ECON cruise speed regardless of wind errors.
- Name: Putinisaknob
  Comment: Having just spoken with a thirty year and 22,000 hour training captain, this is absolute cobblers. Whilst you can set an ETA it is almost never used. Can you imagine using this going across the pond? ATC would do their fruit. Another example of being taught stuff incorrectly...

  Comment: @ATPLQ, I totally agree with Hassib on the idea, that FMS will just give you new estimates. The function of maintaining the preset point crossing time is an option and needs to be programmed by pilots additionally, sometimes it even exceeds the AC capability and FMS will state that. So in general, it just shows you what changes are there based on wind. Though, thats digging too deep into FMS functions and apparently Its not what EASA wants. So lets just assume, that FMS does some magic and always keeps the AC arriving on time. Haha. Other answers are more ridiculous though.
- Name: SMU
  Comment: I might not agree with the correct answer but the other options are way more incorrect
- Name: Hassib
  Comment: @ATPLQ Regarding this specific question, your explanation is incorrect, FMS calculations are based on crew input, lets say actual wind at FL350 is 150/80 and mistakenly it is entered by crew as 050/80, FMS will do all its calculation based on 050/80 and provides ETA and fuel Calculation based on wrong inserted wind. RTA is a completely different function in FMS and has nothing to do with what the question asks. If actual wind differs with inserted wind in the FMS, ETA will be shown either early or late based on what wind direction and velocity inserted in contradiction with actual wind. Thank you!
- Name: James
  Comment: The FMS will only increase your speed to attain a RTA (required time of arrival). This has to be inserted into the FMS by the crew. If this is not done all that happens is that your actual time of arrival at waypoints will be later than your estimated time of arrival at said waypoints.

Question Number: AT00005
- Name: TRUMP88
  Comment: Arriving at DESTINATION = FINAL reserve + ALTERNATE fuel
Arriving at ALTERNATE = FINAL reserve ONLY
- Name: Thordur
  Comment: Also fell for it, contigency is not added as the question is asking, what MINIMUM fuel is to be expected to have remained onboard after landing under NORMAL circumstances - contigency fuel is and shall be used under normal circumstances, thus the MINIMUM fuel to be expected is ALTN and final reserve fuel.
- Name: Nikko
  Comment: Contingency not included as a minimum because it exists as a buffer for unforeseen, minor changes en route. It exists so that when you have to detour, change altitude or speed because of unexpected ATC or weather issues you have a buffer. If it was a minimum requirement at destination then that would mean you could not use it en route - which contradicts its purpose.
- Name: Rad07
  Comment: Seen IAA, but it was reworded, Final reserve fuel was stated as (RSF) but concept the exact same.
- Name: Vafut
  Comment: Not true. Based on weather forecast if it is sure that weather will improve at Dest., the PIC can decide not to go to alternate and use the ALTN in hold over Dest..
- Name: Serkan
  Comment: @jonathan @SariCizmeli contingency is carried for additional fuel consumption enroute due to wind and etc so you can use that fuel and assume that it is used in questions like this
- Name: jonathanlaukner
  Comment: In M&B i just had a question asking about the fuel and it states: "The Landing Mass at Dest. is DEFINED with the ZFM + Cont. + Alternate + Final Reserve Fuel"

So if the Mass is defined that way, why not add the cont?
- Name: CookieMonsta
  Comment: pretty weird how it emphasizes NORMAL which in that case i would also add contingency fuel but then says minimum so alternate + final would be correct
- Name: HarryPotter
  Comment: Tricky Question and there's a few in the bank like this. The EASA examiner never considers
the contingency fuel as an "EXPECTED MINIMUM FUEL". I know this is technically incorrect, we don't plan to use the contingency fuel but the examiner assumes the pilots "expect" or "plan" to use it.

So the answer will either be: Final Reserve + Alternate Fuel = Destination
OR Final Reserve = Alternate

  Comment: Guys I believe I got it Normal conditions is the usual, so don't get misled by it.

-If it says MINIMUM REQUIRED - then exclude the contingency from the expected LM as it is not a requirement,

- Name: Radoslaw
  Comment: The whole stupid story is to mislead you
- Name: Sydney
  Comment: As everyone else is saying - the question stresses "normal conditions" and "expected" fuel (not required). Expected would include contingency. Required would only be Alternate & Final Reserve (at destination). Very badly written.
- Name: 737spacecadet

  Comment: @Uffhansa There are 2 very similar questions: 333260 (this question) and 336167. The 2 questions are almost identical however, in one of them the pilot is being radar vectored, whilst in the other the pilot is not being radar vectored.
@Noworries The 2 questions do not contradict, they are referring to 2 different scenarios. The issue is that in question 333260 it is not made clear that the pilot is not being radar vectored.

  Comment: Maybe it is 6,500ft because the grid altitude at EDNP is the same grid altitude of the grid above which is 5,400 ft.
I think it could be, since every grid has a grid altitude in red, except for this one, and maybe this means that it has the same grid altitude than the upper grid.

- Name: Bonus
  Comment: Why we don't add 15% in this case ? Thx for info.
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: guys the question is very poorly written but what it is saying is:
the a/c minimum fuel at the alternate must be at leas the FRF. so 45mins of holding FF gives us a FRF=45liters.
this means that at destination our minimum fuel must be FRF+alternate fuel= 45+38= 83liters.

so when the aircraft arrives at destination he still has its "minimum fuel at destination which is 83liters.

  Comment: Please let me know if my understanding is wrong?


*Reserve for Piston= 45Min - Question says that fuel flow is 80L/h -> how much it will be in 45Min? 45Min x 80L/h /60= 60L Arriving at destination 60L + 22L of Go Around (when you arrive at your destination you will have it on board) = 82L at Destination


* To fly to Alternate you will use 38L -> 60L - 38L= 44L at Alternate

  Comment: 45 minutes holding

CAT.OP.MPA.181 (c) (5)

final reserve fuel/energy that shall be the amount of fuel/energy that is calculated at
holding speed at 1 500ft (450 m) above the aerodrome elevation in standard conditions
according to the aeroplane estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate
aerodrome, or destination aerodrome when no destination alternate aerodrome is
required, and shall not be less than:
(i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, the fuel/energy to fly for 45 minutes; or
(ii) for turbine-engined aeroplanes, the fuel/energy to fly for 30 minutes

Honestly this should have been in the explanation instead of saying it is not known..
- Name: Phoebe
  Comment: Can someone confirm whether this is holding or cruise speed? Personally would have said it was 45 mins at CRUISE speed (as many others have too). If it is at holding speed, would you say this was appealable?

Thanks!!
- Name: Alexandros
  Comment: is it still confirmed 83/45 for Austro? As according to the theory, it should be 98/60 as you are supposed to use cruise consumption for a piston engine and NOT holding.
Would love a quick response!
- Name: Roman
  Comment: I suppose that find final reserve fuel for 45 min (45L) is enough to pass it and proceed ahead.
- Name: Antoniorosado94
  Comment: So, this question is actually incorrect, because its fuel to flow for 45 min, not at holding speed. Then, what should we do? Memorize this answer? Appeal in the exam if we get it wrong? Actually, I dont have any idea on how to face these exams where the answers are wrong and sometimes you have to give the right answer and sometimes the wrong us the right one. I wanna die

  Comment: Thank you, @Edoardo, for bringing the error to our attention! We apologize for the mistake in the holding fuel consumption that was initially provided. Nonetheless, we are pleased to inform you that the final result was accurate, and we have since corrected the error.

  Comment: Final reserve

Piston = 45min at normal operating (cruise) speed

Jet = 30min at holding speed 1500ft above (alternate) aerodrome level
- Name: Alex
  Comment: In the question hold speed fuel flow is given as 60l/h and cuise speed fuel flow as 80l/h. In the explaination it says calulate it as 45/60 x holding speed fuel flow = 45/60 x 80, but 80 is cruise flow, so it says use hold fuel flow but then youve used cruise fuel flow. Confused.
- Name: PietroEletto
  Comment: @atpl question number 333233 you give us the opposite answer (98 USG ; 60 USG ). Match the questions please and correct them!!
Anyway, I dont know the feedback from EASA, but PadPilot says specifically for reciprocating engine we should use 45 min at cruise level. So damn absurd..
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi everyone, thank you for all your comments!
This question has been reviewed and updated. The regulation is quite ambiguous, it says that for reciprocating engines, the final reserve equals the fuel required to fly for 45 minutes and it doesn't specify if it's at holding or cruising speed.
If anyone comes across this question, please let us know! :)

- Name: Lorenz
  Comment: @ATPLQ The Padpilot book stated 30 min at holding speed 1500ft for jet and ''FUEL TO FLY'' without mentioning HOLDING speed for 45 minutes for the reciprocating engine (CAT.OP.MPA.150).
Would you mind posting the official document?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Lorenz, "fuel to fly" is exactly what is written. It does not have to be cruising. Therefore holding conditions can be used.

  Comment: Fuel Burnt: 1098 — 780 = 318 lb
Distance covered burning the fuel above: 183 NM
Distance remaining to go to B: 460 — 183 = 277 NM

If we burnt:
183 NM = 318 lb
277 NM = ? lb

277 x 318 / 183 = 481 lb

Remaining fuel at airport B: 780 — 481 = 299 lb

- Name: MarkW
  Comment: Fuel burnt so far after 183 NM: 1098 - 780 = 318 lbs
We will burn in total: 460 NM / 183 NM = 799 lbs
We had 1098 lbs, so we end with 1098 lbs - 799 lbs = 299 lbs (plus reserves)
- Name: Qasimmohmammed
  Comment: 318lb burned in 183NM
SO 318/183 =1.73lb/NM
TOTAL distance is 460NM
Fuel consumption is 460NM multiple by 1.73lb/NM=799
Feul remaining is 1098-799=299
- Name: Tim07
  Comment: "assuming conditions remain the same" refer to the conditions we have now, as they're listed before. But instead of writing "and given" they should mark it as planned or something. Pretty confusing wording.

- Name: josselintixier
  Comment: from A, you covered 183 Nm and burnt 318lbs
460 (total distance) /183 = 2.51
2.51 x 318 = 799.34 (fuel burnt for 460Nm)
1098 (trip fuel) - 799 = 299l
- Name: RajHamsaXAir
  Comment: I think that fuel flow given in the question should say ''PLANNED average fuel flow'', or ''planned fuel flow'', so as to avoid confusion by the students.
- Name: Paul82
  Comment: The wording is terrible. The question part, ie the sentence with colon at the end, instructs you to use the following data. There is no arguing that that's what it says. Then you go ahead and use the following data and they go "aha! you used the wrong data". This is not even funny anymore.
- Name: Monica
  Comment: Friends, don't overcomplicate it. Consider that at 183 NM, they consumed 318 lbs, so at 460 NM they will consume 799 pounds. This leaves them with a remaining fuel of 299 lbs. Enjoy the 3 free points
- Name: SHIYU

- Name: Razinzaki
  Comment: So how do I specifically know when to use the fuel flow given when if it says "planned fuel flow" I should ignore but with just "fuel flow" it would presumably mean that that is the correct fuel flow for the remainder of the given sector..
- Name: Cano2020
  Comment: I calculate it like:
total trip- remaining fuel

1098 lb - 780 lb = 318 lb

318 lb / 183 NM = 1,73 lb / Nm

1,737 Nm x 277 Nm = 481 lb

Remaining fuel = 799 lb - 481 lb = 299

- Name: shuauli
  Comment: 1098-780=318Ib

- Name: Alex
  Comment: This can not be correct! Trip fuel is not the total take off fuel. You can not just subtract the remaining from trip fuel. This is insane! If 1098 would be the take off fuel, then yes. But this is completely wrong in my opinion.

- Name: Michal
  Comment: so basically statement "conditions remain the same AND GIVEN:" is a lie? hahah I have no words about how ridiculous this quesiton is. I honestly can do all of these calculation but I still chose the wrong answer casue I thought that the actual conditions are given so there's no need to calculate them again. It's also disgusting that this questions appeared so many times in official exams.
- Name: LAWRENCE
  Comment: Just a note to those who are sitting the UK CAA version of this Flight Planning exam. This sort of question is a trap, the comments whihc state you should appeal this may not have taken the actual exam and realised there are some issues with that approach. First of all you do not know if you are wrong at the point where you can comment on the question. You don't get the result until the end of the sitting which may be days later and even then if you have more than one question incorrect from the same learning objective you don't know exactly which one is incorrect.
Those who have sat this exam on the CAA system will know that the change to the title of the paper for 2020 syllabus means the title now occupies two lines at the top of the screen covering the comments button. If you need to comment you need to hand a written note to the examiner. How would you know at the point of sitting the exam that this or any question is ambiguous? Lastly, if you are on UK CAA and request a paper to be reviewed (Appeal) there is a significant fee.
The Moral of the story is simple, without resources like ATPLQ we would simply carry on failing these exams and have no idea why.

  Comment: Make it easy !
We burn (1098-780) 318lb for a distance of 183 NM
So for a distance of 460 NM = (318/183) x 460 = 799lb burnt
Then 1098 - 799 = 299lb
Hope it helps ;)

  Comment: Seen UK CAA but they say planned fuel flow
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi guys, thank you for your comments!

This question is without doubt unfortunate. Here are my conclusions:
It seems that there is a similar question to this in our database which uses the fuel flow provided instead of calculating the fuel flow in the first leg. I believe that the difference which leads to different approaches is the wording. In this question, we can see that the examiner states "assuming conditions remain the same" => this leads us to calculate the actual fuel flow for the first leg, disregarding the provided fuel flow for the remaining calculations.
The other question states "assuming the data below" => we are prompted to use the fuel flow provided and not calculate the fuel flow used for the first leg.

I would like to add that we have received several feedback from students confirming the current correct options for both questions. We can only advise you to report this questions in your official examinations, as different people can interpret them differently as the differences are minimal and the solution changes significantly.
- Name: JayDEE
  Comment: I was also lost with this question. But in the end I managed to simplify it.
1) Actual fuel burn: 1.73 lb/ NM
2) 277 NM x 1.73 = 481
3) 780 - 481 = 299

Because:
I consumed 318 lb of fuel to travel 183 NM (1.73lb/N)
So if I want to travel 277 NM I will consume 277 x 1.73 = 481 lbs
If I had 780 left; upon arrival I have 780- 481 = 299 lbs.

  Comment: Hey! @lodovico @Zoltan Felix I had today this question in my exam, and the correct answers is correct here. The fuel flow that they are giving you is the planned, you have to calculate the actual fuel flow with the distanca, the ground speed (Which in both cases is the same), then you calculate the time and with that you calculate the actual fuel flow, which is the one that you will need in the end of the exercise

convert heading to track: 1) xc: 46 x cos (90 -330) = 39.8 2) drift: XC x 60 : TAS => 39.8 X 60 : 300 = 8 drift Right
3) track = heading + drift= 90 + 8 =98°
4) find GS: 46 x cos (98-330) = -28.3 (tailwind) --> Gs: 300 of tas + 28.3 of tw = 328.3 !!
if u completely ignore the fact that u have a heading instead of a track, and use the heading ( which is wrong ) the result is 323!
46 x cos (90-330) = 23 tailwind, gs= 323!!
how should i choose between 320, 325 and 330 idk

- Name: Joris31
  Comment: tail wind component: cos(60) * 46 = 23 kts
cross wind component: sin(60) * 45 = 39.8 kts
so ground speed components are [300+23, 39.8] kts, which norm is 325 kts
- Name: danwen
  Comment: What some here are calculating with cosine to get a tailwind component is not fully true. even an exact crosswind increases the groundspeed because that drift adds to it slightly
- Name: Lince01
  Comment: @MondegoTwoTwoTwo no need to correct for drift because they`re not giving you any track
- Name: Domino093
  Comment: Even marking the correct WV with 46 kts is super tricky, and then, they give you options to so close together. This question was probably made by some jaleous guy, who wasnt good enough to became a pilot, so he ended up creating questions for pilot exam, with pure intetion to fail all of us.

  Comment: when given a course correct CRP for heading and GS
when given heading, no need to correct CRP just read the GS = 325 kt
- Name: VASILEIOS
  Comment: He is not apply the heading change to counteract for the wind. Thats why in crp5 we find 320kt and he finds 325. The thing is that in some questions it applies correction and in some others dont.. Usually when it says Course you have to apply the heading correction for the wind, but when it says heading you dont have to.

  Comment: I got 320kt on my Crp-5 thought maybe im wrong so i tried again and made sure im accurate.
Doubted my crappy Crp-5 as its been through Gnav already (you can imagine the rage).
So I paid for a Crp-5 app right now for 3 euros, and did it as accurate as physically possible.
i still got exactly 320kt.
so my question is, what in the genuine fuvk am i supposed to do? sometimes its using the flight computer, and sometimes were expected to use the formula.
on top of all that the formula doesnt even give you 325kt.
So my question to Easa is, what the genuine fvck are you expecting from us to learn exactly, cuz this is genuinely disappointing for an authority with a 300M euro ANNUAL budget is not able to produce questions that actually make sense.
What a shame.

- Name: SyedAta
  Comment: remember acft is maintaining Hdg not track. so the GS will be 325 kts and not 320.
If it was forcefully maintaining track, then the tail wind component will reduce further and the answer would have been 320 kts. its always better to use manual computer

- Name: Sabrur
  Comment: Okay i'll let y'all know my trade of knowledge since my days back in Gnav and everything.

Scenerio 1: With FPL subject, if the question strictly asks you to find GS or TAS or WCA or drift by giving the 4 other information, basically questions like this, --> ALWAYS use a flight computer and the answer you get in it will be the correct answer provided here.

Scenerio 2: With questions where you have a lot of calculation, specially fuel calculation, they give you TAS and W/V component, and you need to find time, or ff or anything else, use
Wind component = Cos (wind direction - track) x Wind speed (since this method is faster, you use the result to determine your GS.
And you will get correct answers and thus you save time)

I know it's a lot to read but those of you who understands what I'm saying, try it, and you will NEVER get these questions wrong and will save time with the bigger calculation questions.

  Comment: @Phoebe, in this case we mark the wind DOWN because we have HDG given. If we had TRK given, we would mark the wind UP.

quick summary for whoever isn't sure about it:
1) HDG given , TAS - Wind speed, mark it DOWN
2) TRK given, TAS + Wind speed, mark it UP
- Name: Phoebe
  Comment: why do you mark wind down on this one??
- Name: Nathan
  Comment: Given Heading ..NOT track. Therefore don't apply wind down technique - literally line up heading on CRP5 and read off Ground speed.
- Name: Jan737
  Comment: In these questions you have to count with true TRACK, not heading. If true heading is 090 (with wind correction), true TRACK will be around 097 due to wind. Now count it again (or use E6B) and you will get slightly above 325.

Hope it helps, good luck :)
- Name: Christian
  Comment: Put this in your calculator:
COS(330-090)X 46 =-23(Negative means tailwind here because we're using the COS function).
Add 23 to your TAS to get your groundspeed, and round up.

  Comment: Hi @hilmi, it depends on whether your given a track/course or heading. For a heading, you should mark wind speed downwards and for a track, wind speed is marked upwards.
There are other ways of solving this exercises on your flight computer though. The method shown here is one of them.

I hope this helps! 🙂

  Comment: CRP-5:
1- Align TAS(300 kts) with the middle hole;

4- Align the TH given(090º) with the outer scale TH;

Starting at Alpha we have 5690 and after 1 hour of travel reaching Gama we have 4850.

Meaning we wasted 840kg per hour.

- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: the annex says that every 1000kg added, the trip fuel increases by 236kg. which means that every 1000kg added i burn 236kg more.
so if i add 1500kg, i will burn 354kg more of trip fuel. so trip fuel increases by 354kg.
so we have two possible answers. the first one is that if i want to have 1500kg extra usable, other than trip, i will need to add 1500kg+354kg to compensate fro fuel penalty.
the other one is that, if i dont compensate, of the 1500kg i add, 354kg will be lost as trip fuel burnt.
so here our actual extra fuel usable for holding will be 1500kg-354kg=1146kg.
with a FF=4500kg/h i get an extra time of 1146/4500=15mins

  Comment: 1500 Kg include the penalty from additional fuel. So, 1500/1.236 = 1214Kg as real extra fuel. Thus 1214/4500 = 0.2697h ~=16 min. Closest answer 15 min.

- Name: Piotr
  Comment: This can actually be done without calculation, just by logic. If FF=4500 kg/h and they load 1500kg that's 20 min flight time. Except you have to consider operational impact of heavier plane -> more fuel burn. There's only one answer with lower hold time than 20min
- Name: Javier
  Comment: Because you are adding more FUEL so your plane will be heavier and you have a fuel penalty due to that.
- Name: Aris
  Comment: stated positive but why suddenly minus? the impact operational is positive 354 for trip fuel, but why you minus the extra fuel?
- Name: Michal
  Comment: so what these others increases or decreases mean? like this minus 232 or plus 448? Why weare supposed to look at the plus 236kg in the operational impacts section?
- Name: Kadham
  Comment: Detailed explanation:

Penalty meant when you increase your fuel on board you are increasing the weight of the plane as well, so some of that extra fuel going tobe loss because of wieght increasment.

Here in this question for 1000 kg of weight increase you are going to burn 236 kg and this is the penalty

To calculate the penalty this is the formula to use : extra fuel/1000 x fuel panelty

So 1500/1000 x 236 = 345 and this is going to be a useless amount of fuel . Means going to be burn because of increasment of plane weight

So now to calculate the endurance of useful fuel from the 1500 we have to subtract the panelty
1500- 236=1146 and this is the useful fuel

To calculate the endurance of it devide it by the fuel flow

1146 / 4500= 15 mints

- Name: WAYNE
  Comment: Hmmmmmm. One has to consider the extra burn due to the 1500kg extra fuel carried. You can't just carry extra fuel weight without a penalty??In the operational impacts column it is 236kg extra burn per 1000kg= 348kg. >> 1500kg-348kg= 1152kg left. This will only give you 15min of holding at destination..

  Comment: Hello @matant01, thank you for your feedback. There is a similar question to the one you mentioned in our database, question number 337947.
- Name: kotasz
  Comment: Guys. I have 4 different navigation computers. CRP 5: 7 degrees left, GS=158. ASA E6-B: 7 degrees left, GS=158. AVIAT 617: 7 degrees left, GS=158. COMPUTADOR DE VOO from Brazil, EA-2: 7 degrees left, GS=158. I really dont get how you can get any other value on any of the existing flight computers. This type of question, with HDG provided, is the most straight-forward one. You put the wind point under the circle, then you set the heading and TAS and you are done. You can only encounter difficulties when the track is given instead of HDG. In this case, do not use the traditional wind down method with its iterative process. Rather, mark the wind point ABOVE the middle circle and set track under the heading. Then you set TAS under the wind point. And you always get a very accurate result.

  Comment: Using trigonometry, the drift is 6,14 DEG Left. because CWC = 19,28kts (lets say 19kts)
HWC is 23 kts. (precisly 22,98 kts).
so the only correct GS= 157 kts. but not a single option of that?
Even on back side of E6B on the bottom, if you look 40 deg in horizontal row and 30 kts in vertical row for windspeed it says 23 KTS for HWC and 19 kts for CWC..sad :(

The correct option is: 6 DEG drift to LEFT and GS=157 kts.

  Comment: You have to calculate your real drive using XWC and thereafter XWC x 60 / TAS now you apply the drift on your heading -> 20-6 = 14. Now you can use your Aviation Calculator. Don't get tricked when they give you a Heading!!

  Comment: ok ok ok! I got something here!

Personally i always use the method written on my E6B. Using this method with HDG i got WCA=6R, Drift 6L, which means a track (track made good) of 014. Doing it again with Track 014, it got me the answer that has as correct, GS=158 kts and WCA=7R exactly, which means Drift=7L.

For me it works and im going to keep it as a tip, hope it helps!

Generally appealing on that kind of questions,is a good strategy cause in any way, answers are so close and appealing them makes me them dissappear from the exam generators of the competent authorities.

  Comment: All your crp5 drift calculations using the dot up method? isn't this method only accepted up to ppl level since the drifts cannot be balanced and the answer is not accurate? the answer is wrong using the dot down method!

the following is a message on the crp5 handbook pg 33

A WORD OF WARNING FOR CPL/ATPL STUDENTS

An alternative way of solving this problem has its advocates who claim that their method is easier because it does not require any moving of the computer to balance the drifts. unfortunately their method requires the wv to be marked on the window in reverse and the learning of a completely new set of rules. furthermore, unlike the professionals' method described above, their method cannot be used to solve all other types of problems. the cpl/atpl student is strongly advised to stick with the methods in this handbook and avoid getting involved with limited use short-cuts, particularly if they require committing non-standard procedures to memory.

  Comment: please review this question

1. effective TAS: cos(sin-1(wind/TAS)) x TAS = 177.48
2. GS: cos(40) x wind (30) = -22.98 (HWC) + 177.48 = 154.49
3. XWC using CR-3: sin(40) x 30 (wind) = 19.28 --> closest Drift: 6 deg

  Comment: Flying east = odd FL
According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for an easterly magnetic track, Odd FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft must be followed.
minimum safe altitude along the whole route is 7 200 ft. But that would be FL750. But that is not an option, so let’s find which one is:

It has to be Odd, so:

Even / Odd
FL650 / FL750
FL850 / FL950

Only option FL950

Question Number: AT00029
- Name: hahahahaha
  Comment: The solution is incorrect.

Considering the case of MLM
- DOM + Traffic + Fuel on board - Fuel penalty= 122550+43217 +(51616-45854)-(51616-45854)/1000*394 = 169258

The loadable weight considering MLM = 182000-169258 = 12741
-> considering the fuel penalty, the full fuel = 12741/1000*394+12741 = 17760

Loadable weight under MTOM = 233000 - 43127 - 51616 = 15617 < 17760

so the answer is 15617 kgs, not 14597 kgs.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @hahahahaha. The explanation and option are correct.
Maximum landing mass (MLM) - Actual landing mass = MLM - (Actual take-off mass - trip fuel) = MLM - (Dry operating mass + Traffic load + Planned take-off fuel - Trip fuel) = 182 000 kg - (122 550 kg + 43 217 kg + 51 616kg - 45 854 kg) = 182 000 kg - 171 529 kg = 10 471 kg
Increased Trip Fuel = 394 x (10 471 / 1 000) = 4 125 kg
10 471 + 4 125 = 14 597 kg
- Name: moczymorda
  Comment: calculated it twice, i would go for 15617. It is within limits.
- Name: Jor117
  Comment: 15617kg is correct, as it's within MLM after the extra full penalty
- Name: dichko
  Comment: Just try with 15617 kg:
New ATOM = DOM + TL + TOF (initial) + EF
New ATOM = 122550 + 43217 + 51616 + 15617 = 233000 (right into the limits)
New Fuel Penalty (FP) = 15617/1000x394 = 6153 => New Trip Fuel (TF) = 45854 + 6153 = 52007 kg
LM = ATOM - TF = 233000 - 52007 = 180993 kg (MLM = 182000 kg)
I think Fuel Penalty should apply on what is extra compared to the initial plan. In our case only Extra Fuel.

  Comment: please have a look to olivier comment, because the method you use is wrong since you apply the correction to the remaining extra fuel at destination and not the one you have at takeoff. Is this answer based on actual feedback ?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @AlessandroB. Yes, this answer is based on actual feedback. We apply the correction to the difference between the maximum landing mass and the actual landing mass, not to the extra fuel at the destination. Because the maximum amount of discretionary fuel is limited by the maximum landing mass (MLM) in this question. Thank you for your comment.

  Comment: What happens if it exceeded MTOW after adding fuel penalty?
- Name: yahya777
  Comment: All Comments Are not understandable to me

** we have to find most limited Tom**

1- Tom from landing mass ( MLM + trip )=227854 ==> smaller then Mtom
2- find actual tom ( Dom+TL+ToF)=217383

** we can take-off and land with tom from landing mass (227854kg)**
** but actual tom that is currently available is less then then that we get from LM**
** so we can carry extra fuel or any load that is (LM tom - Actual tom )= 10471kg

3- We will get 10471kg By subtracting Limited Tom Getting from LM with Actual TOM

** Apply penalty on 10471 kg

4- Penalty on 10000 => ( 10X394 = 3940kg , and for remaining 470kg that will be less then the Half of 394 =>186
5- Total penalty 3940+186=4126
Penalty of extra load + Extra load ( 4126+10471)=14588kg

  Comment: but with that amount of extra fuel, we are way above our Regulated TOM (RTOM) with MLM+TF.. so why is it correct if it is not allowed to Take off with that amount of fuel?
- Name: Adolph
  Comment: @Pawel when they ask for maximum possible extra fuel, MZFM is never limiting, so the only 3 values that limit your fuel will be MTOM, MLM, and maximum possible fuel according to the tank capacity.
Keep in mind that fuel penalty is ONLY applied to the extra fuel possible at from LANDING calculations; then you just select the most limiting value from the 3 numbers you get
- Name: Pawel
  Comment: Could You explain why in some quiestions (like No. 338671) we have to calcuate the most limiting MTOM and other questions like this one, we just skip this part and move to calculations for extra fuel? And also if we check the most limiting MTOM why don't we check the option MZFM+ T/O fuel? Thanks in advance
- Name: iloveeasa69
  Comment: Hi , please check your answer again. If we bring 15,617 kgs of extra fuel at take-off, my fuel burn penalty is 15,617/1,000 x 394 = 6,153. Then at landing, my landing mass will be DOM+Traffic Load+Planned T/O Fuel + Extra Fuel (15,617) - Planned Trip - Fuel Penalty = 122550 + 51616 + 43217 + 15617 - 45854 - 6153 = 180993, which is LESS than the maximum landing weight.

  Comment: I passed M&B with 89% but I feel like a beginner when I do this..
- Name: winaol
  Comment: The proposed method to calculate the fuel penalty is not correct. A simple cross-check: applying the fuel penalty of 394 kg/ton to the 14956 kg of extra fuel gives a penalty of 5750 kg, so the landing fuel will be 8845 kg, which is lower than our target max landing fuel of 10471 kg. This is because the extra fuel of 4125 kg used to carry the 10471 kg will in turn generate a fuel penalty of 1625 kg, which will cause an extra burn of 640 kg, and so on (252, 99, 39, 15, 6, 2, 1), for a total of 6804 kg.
So, the max extra fuel limited by MLM is 17275 kg, which could have been calculated directly so : 10471/(1-0,394) as described by Paolo in an earlier message.
As this exceeds the 15617 kg allowed by the MTOM limit, that value becomes the max allowable tanker on take-off.

  Comment: @atplq I think this answer is wrong, I leaned that for fuel penalty you should calculate it this way:

FP= 1000-394/1000 = 0,606 (every extra fuel I carry at landing I would have 0,606 kg)
maximum extra fuel at landing/FP

If you apply this formula you should get 17278,8
Is this an old question? has it appeared recently?
- Name: Pawel
  Comment: Here you should not exceed MTOM while starting (with penalty fuel still not burnt) and MLM while landing (when penalty is burnt, additionaly to planned Trip Fuel).

Limit (A) => MTOM - Actual Take Off gives underload = 15 617 kg (penalty not burnt)
Limit (B) => MLM - Actual LM gives underload = 10 471 kg (penalty burnt)

Our weight sums are:
1. DOM: 122 550 kg
2. Traffic Load: 43 217 kg
3. Remaing of planned T/O Fuel (T/O Fuel - Trip Fuel) 51 616 kg - 45 854 kg = 5 762 kg
4. Extra fuel after burining penalty, one of two options:

(A) For Take Off limited Underload*: 15 617 kg*_______After burining penalty______=> 11 202 kg
(B) Landing limited Underload*: 14 597 kg _______After burining penalty______=> 10 471 kg*

While both variants don't exceed MTOM (233 000kg), for MLM (182 000):
- (A) 122 550 + 43 217 + 5 762 + 11 202 = 182 731
- (B) 122 550 + 43 217 + 5 762 + 10 417 = 181 946
Only (B) fits, so maximum Extra Fuel including any penalty that can be load without exceeding limits is:

14 597 kg.
- Name: Jon
  Comment: DOM + TRAFFIC LOAD + TAKE OFF FUEL = TOM
122550 + 43217 + 51616 = 217383

Find the Take Off Underload by subtracting this from MTOM:
233000 - 217383 = 15617

TOM - TRIP FUEL = LM
217383 - 45854 = 171529

Landing Underload = MLM - LM
182000 - 171529 = 10471

Take the lowest of our Take Off or Landing Underload. In this case 10471 as it's smaller than 15617.

Apply the fuel penalty = (10471/1000)*394 = 4125.57

Add this to our Landing Underload. 10471 + 4125.57 = 14597.

Double check this fits in the tank - yes loads of room. So 14597 is the answer

  Comment: Sorry to bother you with this, @ATPLQ, but I think it would really be useful for the questions which were seen in an official exam, but have no comments (so that we are able to make an idea if it was recent or not), we also had the approximate date when they have been reported.

  Comment: maybe some of you would like to impress themselves with what they already know and end up with a wrong answer. remember ICET. a looked at given data, spotted flight level (felt like a winner already) and treated TAS like IAS and applied 2%/1000ft correction. EASA anticipated and gave the result of my way of thinking as one of the answers! obviously wrong. good luck and keep it simple ;)

  Comment: Hi guys. This question only asks for “VFR arrivals to Dubrovnik” and the correct answer is 5. We believe that the question you encountered in your official exams and whose answer is 10 is the question in the database with question number 337414, which asks “How many visual procedures are published?”
We also believe that your feedback on the options may be related to question 337414. We will therefore continue to monitor your feedback to update relevant questions. Thank you all for your valuable feedback.

2 options were something like '5 bi-directional at 1500' or '10 bidirectional at 1500'' and another one '10 total, 1500' altitude for departure and 1000' if flying inbound'.

I chose the '5 bi-directional at 1500'.

  Comment: I dont believe it was different, but Ill give you the benefit of the doubt. Nonetheless for the UK it was clear 5000kg , which was marked correct.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @SimonC with the numbers given in the question, there is no doubt that the correct answer is 4000 kg. The graph is more than clear and not even an interpolation is required. Of course, a combination of different numbers may lead to a 5000 kg answer. We are looking forward to receiving further feedback.

- Name: Imran289
  Comment: please check this. The question asked specifically for the MAXIMUM amount that can be tankered, that would be 10,000kg. Not the optimum tankering of 4000kg. Taking the already 30T onboard to 40T (the max capacity). This is also within MLM limits.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hey guys, thank you for your comments! We have updated the question text. If anyone comes across this question in their official exam, kindly let us know where they ask for the optimum or maximum amount of fuel which may be tankered. Thank you and best of luck with your exams!
- Name: Hossein123
  Comment: basically, this is just 1 new step to what you already know if you finished the previous fuel section

find the limit in, and take the lowest:
MTM - ATM
MLM - ALM
F.T - fuel.total

but now our new step is to use the graph and apply fuel ratio from the left, go right to our NM and go down to our optimum weight
subtract optimum weight and our take off mass = 4000

so, find the lowest in:
MTM - ATM
MLM - ALM
FC - FL
OW - ATM

Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) is a generic expression, used in various cases to denote an altitude below which it is unsafe to fly owing to presence of terrain or obstacles. An ICAO definition of the term "minimum safe altitude" as such does not exist.
- Name: tecnamodi
  Comment: Comment from @rixii really solved all MSA questions from me. Just add/subtract 180 to the radial and it makes it much simpler when trying to find which direction you're coming from. Big credits to him
- Name: Toaster
  Comment: Also if you're not sure which side of 60° to go, remember headings clockwise from north so 63 will be in 5900 sector not 3500.
- Name: Toaster
  Comment: I like others kept getting this wrong but then realised it's actually quite easy, you just add or subtract 180° to get the radial and match it to a sector. I think I got this on my first attempt and it was 2 points in austro.
- Name: AnuBoswell
  Comment: This one got me, 243 radial. -180 = 63 degrees! Which puts you in the 5900' side! Be careful!

- Name: PabloPIC
  Comment: Does anybody else understands from the question that the aircraft is tracking radial 243 TO the VOR? Or am I getting confused with the question wording?
- Name: Kokoszka17
  Comment: To everyone saying it should be 3500 - unfortunately not and I was thinking the same thing as you until I studied the MSA picture a bit more. If you look at the approach following R175 and R355 you'll notice that they are 180 degrees apart which divides the circle in two. HOWEVER radials 60 and 245 are NOT 180 degrees apart but 185 degrees which makes the 2 halves of the circle uneven. Therefore R243 is a reciprocal of R63 which is unfortunately still in the 5900 MSA sector.

This chart was carefully chosen by EASA because of the tricky MSA sector divide which probably fooled many pilots.
- Name: rixii
  Comment: Maybe try to convert it to headings.

R243 - 180 = 063 heading towards the VOR which places it in 5900ft sector between headings 060 to 175 degrees.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Ran, radial 243 is in the sector between radial 240 and 355. The sector is designated with the headings 060 and 175 respectively.
- Name: Dennis
  Comment: It should be 3500
- Name: The struggle
  Comment: The answer should be 3500ft as the 243 radial would be extending into that section. The explanation would state more than 245 degrees.

Do not confuse, the GNSS must be check before departure, when you are planning the flight, AT or FOR the time you will need to use , in this case at IAF.

The most correct answer would be, GNSS must be check before departure FOR the time/at the time you will use.

- Name: DennisBertram
  Comment: Could you explain when you start with the pressure correction and when you start with the temperature correction?

This changes between each question.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @DennisBertram. It depends on whether you're converting from true altitude to pressure altitude or vice versa. You can clearly see the sequence of corrections in the figure attached to the explanation.
For example, if you're given a true altitude and need to convert it to pressure altitude, the steps are as follows:
1. Apply the temperature correction to the true altitude to get the indicated altitude.
2. Then apply the pressure correction to the indicated altitude to obtain the pressure altitude.
To go from pressure altitude to true altitude, you simply reverse the process.
Hope this helps!

Now what ? True altitude above an elevation is the True Altitude if the sea was as high as the elevation ? Question should clearly ask for height or absolute altitude above ground.

- Name: Niklas2002
  Comment: i think you misunderstood me here a bit. The question you created did not appear in my exam. It actually was exactly this question, the only difference was the wording.

Instead of asking: What is the approximate height above the airfield datum?
The LBA question asked: what is the true altitude above the aerodrome datum?

One possible answer was: 2330ft
The other possible answer was: 3680ft (which can be close enough to T.Alt, especially when using 27ft/hp)

I appealed the question but i dont know which answer they consider as correct

  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL). In this case, the airfield elevation is said to be 1 416 ft, and it must be taken into account for the temperature correction.
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

- Name: Harrison
  Comment: Did this a different way and got the same answer.

1. Calculate new TAS by comparing new leg times. 36 mins (old total for everything post failure) divided by 47 mins gives 0.766. 0.766 X 130 (planned TAS) gives 100 knots.

2. Compare new fuel flow. 207/211.7 gives 97.78%.

So we are flying a lot slower for approximately the same fuel consumption.

  Comment: But the whole calculation doesn't sum up. Even if we had not slowed down beween VJF and Tarifa, with the current FF we would have landed with 83kg in the Tanks, not 120kg. It's not clear what this Q wants from us. I calculated different scenarios but had the A/C not decreased speed, the FF would have been bigger (164kg/h) and with remaining 48 minutes before VJF we would have landed with 75,8 kg or with remaining 36 minutes after Tarifa we would have landed with 108,5 kg. All of this is less than the estimated 120kg. So with our revised FF of 141 kg/h we will land with 97kg which is in the middle of the 3 calculated values.

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @CharlieBravo. We need the actual values of consumption and not the estimated ones. The beginning and ending times of the period when 40 kg of actual fuel was consumed are indicated in red boxes in the annex in the explanation section. These times are 15:51 and 16:08 and the difference between them is 17 minutes. Therefore, the explanation is correct. Thank you for your comment.

  Comment: from position vjf to tariff 17 minutes flight time and fuel used 40 kg ,

so 40 divided 17 minutes , 2.35 kg per minute ,

2.35 x 47 =110 kg, now add all the fuel legs equal 223 plus 110 equals 333 kg,

now subtract (actual after speed slow) 333 with (estimated) 309 we will have 24 kg difference and yes here is the answer.. ..

- Name: Ezequiel
  Comment: As the last comment said, use the logic! The question states that from Tarifa to LEMG now it's estimated in 47 mins, add those 47 mins to the last WPT ATO (16:08), it will give an ETA to LEMG at 16:55. NOW, compare this ETA to the original planned umsing the T/O time, this result will give you 16:37 PLANNED ETA, you will now see that your flight time will be LONGER! There's one possible answer. Hope it helps! :)

All 4 answers gave different times for both sectors i just mentioned. one of the answers was 23 minutes for both distances (thats what i took) and no answer was even close to 23 minutes.. all of them like 11 or 7 minutes or something like that..
All in all i would say about 75% ATPL Q coverage but with the knowledge of these examples here absolutely doable.

But there is really an easy way to solve it:

Question Number: AT00043
- Name: Muhammedkasem
  Comment: Shouldn't we select FL 7000, and this is where the trick lies. FL 6000 would certainly provide the greatest SGR (Specific Ground Range), but it is not among the permitted flight levels. The next altitude that gives the highest SGR is FL 7000, which is within the allowed flight levels, so it should be selected.

I would appreciate any feedback from the exam or the team.e
- Name: Ilaymad
  Comment: No need to calculate, look for the highest GS.
I chose 7,000 ft because there is a minimum height requirement. Surely appealable!

  Comment: IAA 26/06/2025 only 10,000 was listed as the maximum altitude as well as the 7000ft minimum.

- Name: DRMode
  Comment: The only way I can see an appeal for 7000' failing is because the question states "What altitude provides the highest ground milage per GPH?" and does not imply that you actually have to fly at that altitude, just calculate the figure.

In real life I would not even consider calculating an altitude I cannot fly at, but it is EASA asking here and we all know that their thinking is not logical.

  Comment: SInce the Fuel Flow of 15.5GPH is the same at all altitudes, as the question itself is telling us, yes, as @SKyDweller said, we just need to search for the highest GS since it will give us the best "milleage" on a specific consumption. (Not neccesarly the lowest headwind as we could have a higher TAS to compensate!) If the FF were to vary between altitudes, then we would divide the GS by the appropriate FF to find the miles flown with that specific consumption at that specific speed.

I personally did not need it in the FP exam. Got everything for my questions printet on Din A3 from the Examination Centre. Think it depends where you plan to write your exam, so check that, and if you are unsure, take it with you.
For Performance and Mass/Balance i recommend, take CAP698 and CAP696 with you if you are allowed.

  Comment: I also found exactly the same question of Alex44 on my exam with Austro today 6 November 24
- Name: Alex44
  Comment: Austro Vienna Update 05.11.24 (2 Pointer Question)
The Minimum Altitude is 4000 ft not 6000ft!

The question is different than here. First of all you get a table Annex with different power settings ( 75%, 65% and 55%) the question asked about the 75%. So choose that table. Then you have 3 Headwinds:
4000 feet 3 kt
6000 feet 6kt
8000 feet 9kt

The TAS you find in the Table. But you only get 6000feet and 8000feet straight. For 5000 feet and 7000 feet you need to interpolate.

I got those:
5000 feet ( dont remeber but was clearly lower)
6000 feet GS 174 kt
7000 feet GS 173,5kt
8000 feet GS 173,5 kt

The Answers were
A: 5000 feet
B: 6000 feet ( correct one like marked here)
C: 7000 feet
D: 8000 feet
So now i think the question is good to go.

By the way the Flight Planning subject was very Banky. I had 4-5 new questions but the Calculations were like in training, nothing bad to expect. Good Luck!

Item 35 - MOCA refers to 4500T on the opposite page (So 5000T correct answer for this question)
- Name: MattMad
  Comment: Explanation is wrong!
Find Jeppesen Introduction pdf for free. Page 61.

MOCA is Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude, example 5000T
I remember it as C like Clearance to obsTruction, so it's about T letter accent.

MORA is Minimum Off-Route Altitude, example 4000a
I remember it as MORAAA, so the little "a" after the altitude.

MEA is Minimum Enroute Altitude, example 6000
It's without anything more.

MAA is Maximum Authorised Altitude, example MAA7000
Its with MAA letters, so no problem.

- Name: ricardgalisteo
  Comment: For people who can't memorize:
All charts are oriented to true north, which means that IFR and VFR charts will point in that direction, so the chart does not need to "rotate" over time, now for a HEADING GIVEN in a chart they are all MAGNETIC

More context:
VORs are built heading true north, but potentiometer adjustment is used to make its radials match with magnetic north. ALL headings in JEPPSEN or IFR routes are like this. Look for charts oriented to magnetic north, it's hard to find any because that'd split Canada in half. This also doesn't make all charts de facto "obsolete" every time magnetic north changes, and so it is only needed to apply the correction. Also because not all aircraft have the ability to follow true headings or even if you have the ability, for most utility airplanes is not that precise

- Name: Nickyp1982
  Comment: Can someone please explain why the variation is 3w and not 4w? In the explaination it says the variation is running straight through the airway where actually w004 is running through the centre. Also Norbo is close to 5w and Talla is close to 3w (on the 4w side) so I took the average which would be 4w. many thanks

So same answers, wind direction just to fool you.
- Name: MrATPL
  Comment: The course on the chart is given as magnetic.

Since we APPLY THE VARIATION AT THE VOR, and not at the A/C we do the following.

1. On the chart read of the variation in the area of the VOR (which is 3W).
2. Apply the variation on the magnetic course given on the map from NORBO (TH = MH + Var -> TH = 99 + -3 = 96).

Therefore the answer is not 95 or 99 but 96.

Question Number: AT00049
- Name: KNekrasovs
  Comment: @FlyerDaniel yeah, in this subject MZFM+trip is never considered and I do not know why.
- Name: FlyerDaniel
  Comment: the question and the resolution are a joke: MZFM + TOF (assumed BF) = 2300kg. So 2300 is maximum allowed TOM. The actual TOM is also 2300, so no possible fuel!!
- Name: CaptainMarius
  Comment: The allowed take-off mass is the lowest of
MSTOM
PLTOM
MSLM+TRIP FUEL=2390kg
PLTOM+TRIP FUEL
MZFM+TOF(NOT USED for extra fuel calculations)
regulated take-off mass (rtom) is the lowest of the "performance limited" tom and "structural limited" tom.=3000kg
so we are taking the 2390 since is the lowest value.
next we calculate our actual take off mass 2000+300=2300(we would take taxi fuel out but we dont know it so we skip it)
therefore our extra weight we can take is 2390-2300=90 kg(in this case of fuel)
lets check based on our tank capacity- 550-300=250kg we can take, but we are limited by the muslim+trip fuel, so we take the lowest value which is 90kg of extra fuel we can take.
- Name: CaptainMarius
  Comment: Regulated Take-Off Mass (RTOM) is the lowest of the "performance limited" TOM and "structural limited" TOM.
- Name: FlyingKuba
  Comment: Only 200kg difference between ATOM and permitted landing mass so:
300 - 190 = 110 - this is value of fuel when we landed
200-110 = 90kg - we can only uplift 90kg because landing mass limit us.
- Name: Sonacapilot
  Comment: This type of questions for sure are a joke for us! So, now we have to assume Block fuel = TOF Fuel? why?
- Name: RotorRider
  Comment: @fly9fly, could be a helicopter or a bush plane the landed on a dirt road (no taxi fuel needed) -> so Block fuel = Take-off fuel

Answer was 400kg, RTOM limited. Tank limit was 450.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello, @Dani! I want to express my gratitude for your feedback. By any chance, do you remember the MLM? Additionally, was the tank capacity mentioned in the question 450 kg or 900 kg? Having this additional information will greatly assist us in creating a more accurate question. Thank you so much!
- Name: flyingaua
  Comment: Austro Vienna exactly the same 31.05.2023
- Name: Assan
  Comment: ATPLQ shouldnt we use MTOM instead of RTOM in your explanation as its more restricting?

RTOM = 3000

MTOM = 2390 which is MLM + Trip Fuel?

The correct answer is still 90kg
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hey @Assan, the maximum take-off mass would have to be provided by the question. You can't assume it like that :)
- Name: Aiman
  Comment: again with the assume
- Name: Luke
  Comment: I guess we just parked on the runway as there is no taxi fuel
- Name: Grant
  Comment: @ATPL Questions - The answer should be zero uplift due to insufficient information. It is a dangerous precedent to set, to assume BLOCK Fuel = T/O Fuel given that two of the answers are only 30kg different which is easily the taxi fuel in a light aircraft in this example and when you get to the heavy jets, taxi fuel gets into the hundreds of kilograms and sometimes into the thousands, one should NEVER assume BLOCK Fuel = T/O Fuel. This is a very poor question.
- Name: ATPL
  Comment: Appeared ULC Poland 10.11, 2 points.
Thanks ATPLQ a lot, today i passed this bloody subject with 94.83%.
RNAV, Human, Airframes and Ops to go!
- Name: LukaSz
  Comment: ZERO Fuel = 2000
Add 300 min fuel = 2300
you will burn 190 of 300 which makes you: 2300 - 190 when landing = 2110
2200 is your max mass for landing which allows you add extra 90 kg

Then check 2300 TOF + 90 = 2390
It is not higher than RTOM 3000
390 in tanks is not higher than capacity 500
- Name: Angelina
  Comment: There are few steps, that can help us to calculate extra fuel, and pick the lowest value, as it limits.
1. Tank capacity- block fuel = 550 kg-300 kg= 250 kg, Limit 1
2. MLM- Actual LM= (Actual LM in our case is AZFM + TOF - Trip fuel), therefore 2200 kg - (2000+300-190)= 90 kg, Limit 2
3. MTOM - Actual TOM ( no data for this limit)
So, conclusion is 90 kg, that can be taking extra in our case.

Hope it helps, if anyone has different way of solving it, please share.

practically the topic of my question regarding the codes about "localizer" and "local". in the explanation you wrote as code of localizer= llz while the code to indicate local = loc.

  Comment: @MC12345
NAM or Nautical AIR miles, is the amount of AIR that you cover in a specific time. Wind has no effect on NAM. It's like the distance that the air travels around/through you and it can be viewed also as endurance, the time you can be "in air."
NGM or Nautical ground miles, is the amount of GROUND that you cover in a specific time. Wind has an effect on NGM and it's, usually, called range. It is the range in km/miles etc. that you can cover on ground.

NGM is dependant on your GS. So if you have a tailwind, you'll cover more ground since your GS will be higher, it will "push" you ahead. If you have headwind, you'll cover less ground, it will (literally) "slow" you down since your GS will be smaller.
As for the NAM, it may help you to visualize, imagine yourself in a wind tunnel. The air is flowing "onto" you. you'll be still, so you are not going to any ground miles, but the air that is flowing onto you will be traveling some air miles. I just hope it was enough, I've tried.

- Name: Joachim
  Comment: @Tomasz, So because this is a specific procedure "isolated aerodrome", we actually do not carry Final Reserves as we included it into the additional fuel for this procedure, which is 2h at cruise consumption over the destination aerodrome.
- Name: Tomasz
  Comment: maybe is a silly question.

But I'm trying to fully understand PDP procedure

what does it mean "including final reserve fuel"??

Are we adding Final reserve fuel (30min in this case) on top of these 2h additional or those 2h additional fuel have 30min FR fuel included) so we don't need to add 30 min.

Hopefully, I expressed myself clearly.

Thanks in advance

- Name: Mahdy
  Comment: TAS increased by 10 = 457
Fuel flow increased by 3% of 1086 = 1118
time = ( 310 / (457 - 25) ) * 1118 * 2 (because 2 engines) = 1604 kg
- Name: Extrafuel
  Comment: This part of your explanation is NOT correct

"With a 25 kt headwind, the groundspeed will be 451 - 25 = 426 kt. Applying the note, the TAS must be increased by 1 kts for each degree above standard TAT. So, it becomes: 426 + 10 = 436 kt"

- It should be, the TAS given from the table "451kts" +10kts for the TAT difference. And then 461kts TAS - 25kts HWC, which will give us the GS 436kts.
- Name: deltaalpha
  Comment: @Maximus18 in the end it's completely irrelevant if you first add 10 and then substract 25 (either +10-25 or -25+10 is the same result). The same with Fuel Flow, since you multiply everything, it's irrelevant wheter you first multiply by 2 and 0.71 and then by 3% or the other way around (principle: 2x3 is the same as 3x2).
Yes you're approach is more structured and logical, and I recommend you to apply it like you did because if you mix a summation with a multiplication, then the result will be wrong.

  Comment: @Billy you get punished for a 36 seconds adjustment. Also you round up for just 6 seconds. Which means that the actual change in a real life scenario is irrelevant. So rounding up or down should still make you get the right answer. As i said, answers are too close for an actual LO.

TAS=Mach*38.95*sqr.root temp in K.
456.7=0.76*38.95*sqr.root (273-35)

Then headwind component = Cos(relative wind angle)*wind velocity.

  Comment: FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT HAVE CRP5:
1. TAS = mach x LSS = 0.76 x 38.35 x square root of oat + 273. TAS= 449 - 64HW = 385 KT (GS)
2. TIME = 90NM/385KT = 0.23H = 14 MIN.
3. 14:58 H + 00:14 h = 15:12 h

  Comment: I too was getting a time of 13 minutes. However, I read Andre's comment and saw he used mach 0.76. I immediately disliked and said he is being ridiculous because the question clearly states mach 0.8. Then I re-read the question, and it was I who was being ridiculous. The mach is reduced to 0.76 which outputs a time of 14 minutes.
I'm sorry for doubting you Andre.

  Comment: @jonathan, in these sorts of problems wind is usually giving in true. So its like using doing conversions, you have to make sure you use the same units. Either putting the magnetic track into true or the wind into magnetic will allow you to use the same units. But with such a small difference in variation, you should be able to get the correct answer either way! :)

  Comment: I do not understand Andre's calculation from March. He uses the unrevised Mach number and mixes magnetic track with true wind. Is it ust accidentally the correct result or is there a scheme behind that?

When I try to do the calculations with the E6B I always end up with 13 minutes flight time as well so its a pity that the answer options are that close together to make the correct answer a matter of luck. In reality nobody would care about 1 minute error in ETA due to rounding issues as the sourrounding conditions like wind are not that constant anyway.

  Comment: Lawrence, not sure about you but Ive passed Meteo and Gnav exams without a problem and had this type of question in both of them. Ive used algebra every time as I found that I occasionally make an error with the computer whereas I never seem to make an error when I use the Mach formula M = TAS/LSS (and for temp -*2 degrees per 1000ft until -56.5 for ISA). I also use trig for wind correction angles as I find the calculator to be faster than the flight computer and also less prone to errors. That leaves the computer just for calcs like compressibility, TAS -> CAS etc. Each one has his way to skin a cat but thats my way.

  Comment: Ok, but why write the wrong time in the table?
11 min for LIBLO to BTA..
Sometimes they want us to calculate and other times to take from the table..
I assumed that it wasn't a full minute (i.e., 11.5 min) and they rounded it down, so the whole calculation relied on it.
- Name: MayorTom
  Comment: Question (what are the new ETAs) , answer = actual GS and added to Actual time , freaking awesome this is madness
- Name: DrPilot
  Comment: The trick here is the wording. At first, you'd think that they want you to use the here already provided GS and to calculate the answer that is ALSO provided among the options, but it's wrong. They want you to use the ACTUAL IN FLIGHT (as per wording..) GS that is NOT provided, so you have to calculate it. Then, they want you to assume that, that GS, will be the same for the next leg just because they "made it clear" by putting in the corresponding box the same 190kt GS value, which is, btw, the wrong one and should not be used. Then, when you make all the necessary calculations by using every single decimal, since the precision IS important, you have to approx. by -3.43 seconds for the first choice and +13.71 seconds for the second choice.Why is this important? Because by approx. during the calculation process, you'll end up with 1 min difference and you'll end up getting the wrong option if you just "trust it." Now, already 1 min diff. is crazy but this.. I just thank God, for he has given me enough patience and strength to keep on laughing at this question even after I have failed it, twice..

Liblo to BTA =12 min for 35 NM =175 kt

13 min times 1.086 =14 min

  Comment: SEEN IN SPAIN with this index and the chart, asking for distances between two positions and the ETAs

  Comment: Much easier way:
From the leg LIBLO-BTA (where the wind is the same as to ELB and UPDADU) do:
Actual Time of Arrival (ATA)/Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)=12/11=1.091. This is your ratio for how much longer each leg takes than planned.
So then for the legs asked: BTA-ELB Estimated leg time: 13minsx1.091 = 14 mins Atual leg time
Leg ELB-UPDAU = 2x1.091=2.182 (not increased enough to be significant)
Then new eta's: 13:31+14=13:45, +2 @elb, +2 =13:47 @upadu

- Name: Subzero
  Comment: Question is asking for ETA and were calculating ATA, aviation makes no sense.

I Never thought I'd get this question wrong lol, if we use the explaination logic than will have to check the whole table time cause maybe they are wrong but our mistake was not checking the previous leg, something very easy but they make it soo complicated damn.

So question asked for the Actual GS, just so you can know nothing in the Table is actual so i think thats how you spot the mistake, this question has constant wind if it wasn't than you'd have to calculate GS for each leg, cause as i mentioned we are looking for actual GS.

-If you still didn't understand just imagine all the GS given in the question are wrong, treat it this way than you'll be able to answer it fast because you know what is the error.

Hope this helps in understanding it abit clear.

  Comment: Daniels explanation works!
- Name: Daniel
  Comment: since i couldn't find any proper explanation of altimetry so far, and really struggled to understand that, im gonna leave my interpretation of what ive gathered so far.

fat pedos touch tom (fptt):
flight lvl -> correct pressure -> then temp -> get true altitude (to get true altitude from flight lvl)
-> to get the flight level from true altitude just follow it the opposite way (first temp, then pressure)

pressure correction:
qnh > isa = subtract
qnh < isa = add

temp. correction (only apply the value from the difference between meteo station and air column)
temp > isa = subtract
temp < isa= add

note that the above is just for when you try to find the flight level from true altitude. if youre trying to get the true altitude from a fl, just applg the oppisite . (ex. temp > isa = add)

In case I forgot anything, or got something wrong please correct me.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL). In this case, the airfield elevation is said to be 875 ft, and it must be taken into account for the temperature correction.
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

  Comment: @Riccardo The way I think about it is: If ISA DEV is colder then it means that I am lower than I think. And if ISA DEV is hotter, I am higher than I think. And after that, I make a mental image of what needs to be done. Here I need to convert to FL, So if I am higher than I think I am, that means I can subtrakt the extra height because I am already higher up. Makes sense?
You have to be careful about when to add and when to subtract.

  Comment: at what altitude is the temp measured at?
- Name: Riccardo
  Comment: TA = 4385 + 1500 = 5885

TA = PA + 30 x (QNH - STD PRESS.) + (4/1000 x ISA DEV x AIR COLUMN)
5885 = PA + 30 x ( 12 ) + ( 4/1000 x 12 x 5010 )
5885 - 360 - 240 = PA
PA = 5284

So minimum safe FL will be FL060 because on FL050 you will be flying 284ft under your safety altitude.

  Comment: TA = 4385 + 1500 = 5885 ft
QNH correction = 1025 - 1013 = 12 hpa (12*30= 360 ft)
TA = 5885 - 360 = 5525 ft
Temp correction TA = IA + or - ( 4*Delta ISA * height above elevation/1000)
5525 - 875 = 4650 / 1000 = 4.65 ft
5525 = IA + (4*12*4.65)
IA = 5525 - 223 = 5302 FT

flight time ( 18:43 - 18:06= 37) at a fuel consumption of 45kg : 0.72 = 62.5 L/ h

(62.5/60) x 37 = 38.5 l REQUIRED TO REGAIN THE TRACK and reach TUSKA

You can also follow the N57 airway and see that it says 161*, add 180 to that and you get 341!

Good luck in exams everyone!

  Comment: Between TRENT (VOR) & POLE HILL (VOR) is Airway N57. It shows a total length of 44NM.

Pole Hill - Denby = 14NM
Denby - Tipil = 23NM
(14NM + 23NM = 37NM)

44NM (total length) - 37NM (Pole Hill-Tipil) = 7NM (Tipil-Trent)

just another way to figure this question out, based on the nautical mile.

Question Number: AT00066
- Name: MajsPL
  Comment: From PadPilot, Additional Fuel has to be included if:
- no destination alternate nominated for procedures contingency 5% or 3%ERA. So with this case alternate fuel=additional fuel, wich is fuel for 15 min hold on 1500ft AGL on holding FF
- if it is anticipated that for some reason it is nesesery to include extra fuel for cases like extra fuel consumption in case of flight level drop due to engine failure or loss of cabin pressure to flight to alternate and hold there for 15 min on 1500ft AGL. This could be case for high certified ETOPS flights.

In this example we have additional fuel enforced on us so it is required to carry on flight. This is convoluted, so If there is mistake please correct me.

  Comment: all this while, all the other questions which were similar did not ask for additional fuel, but why is additional fuel suddenly included in the calculations here? Question 335816 is also similar, except that it is a MRJT in that question. Additional fuel was not included in the calculations there. So what exactly is the difference here? There is alternate fuel here. So far, the general rule has been that if there is alternate fuel, additional fuel is not needed - and this is also mentioned in a number of your explanations for other questions (Question 335497 couldn't make this any clearer). I really hope you can address this question because a lot of students here are also asking the same question and it is not being addressed. Thanks.

  Comment: For anybody who is confused:

Generally, it's true that when you need additional you don't need alternate fuel, and vice versa, WITH ONE EXCEPTION:

ETOPS flights! During ETOPS operations, you carry alternate fuel (because you might still need to go to the alternate when you're done crossing the ocean and you reach your destination) but you also may need to carry additional fuel if the ETOPS enroute alternate is far enough (it's a whole science how to calculate it, thankfully it's not in the syllabus).

As you'll see, the question clearly states with the LONG RANGE jet transport - it's giving you a hint!

So you have to interpolate between 0 ISA and +20 ISA. furthermore interpolate the KTAS between 6000 & 8000 ft. I got 170 TAS. They gave you wind in true, but track in mag so need to do CDMVT. Then find drift using CRAP-5. My answer was 12 degrees right. Good luck guys!!

Question Number: AT00069
- Name: TiagoLH
  Comment: I was struggling with the pressure correction part of altimetry, but Ive finally found a method that works for me. It might not be the most "official" approach, but its helped me consistently get the right answers. Hopefully, it helps someone else too!

Step 1:What the Question Is Asking
In this example-> Pressure Altitude (PA).
The order of solving should go: PA<-IA<-TA
If you need to find TA, you'll go backwards through that chain: TA<-IA<-PA

Step 2: Temperature Correction (TA->IA)
Given:
Temp at the base is -25*°C so,
ISa deviation at 10000 ft = isa temp = 15 - (2x10) = -5°c
actual temp = -25°c so isa dev =-20°c
formula: IA = TA - [4 x (alt /1000) x isa dev]
ia = 8000 - [4 x 8 x (-20)]
ia = 8000 - (-640)
ia = 8640 ft
step 3: pressure correction (ia -> pa)
here's the trick i use:
pa = ia + (1013 - pressure at level) x 27 (If not specified we assume 30)
in this case: pa = 8640 + ((1013 - 990) x 27)
pa = 8640 + (23 x 27)
pa = 8640 + 621 = 9261 ft -> fl100

alternatively, if you go pa ia, reverse the formula:

ia = pa + (pressure at level - 1013) x 30

summary of the trick
when going from ia to pa, use:
pa = ia + (1013 - qnh) 30
when going from pa to ia, use:
ia = pa + (qnh - 1013) 30 - just flip the formula depending on the direction you're going.

- Name: RotorRider
  Comment: @Vitali hello again, The [ISA deviation] will be used to find our (TA)True Altitude. Since it is colder than ISA, our TA should be lower. Using a similar formula for temp.correction 4 x (8000'ft./1000) x [-20] = -640'ft // However, 8000'ft is our MSA, so we cannot be lower than this. Instead of subtracting the value, we add it -> 8640'ft (this is NOT yet a (PA)Pressure Altitude, as we are still using a QNH 990 hPa. The final step is to correct for the pressure setting difference! 990-1013 = 23hPa x 30' = +690 -> PA 9330' or the closest FL100
- Name: RotorRider
  Comment: @Vitalii, since the 'ISA deviation' isn't provided, we need to calculate it using information given. " temperature at FL100 is -25°C we will use this as our reference point: -> in ISA conditions the expected OAT would be 15-(10x2)= [-5°C], so the [ISA deviation is -20°C]

  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL).
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

  Comment: To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250) its from the explanation why this FL?
- Name: Jenu350
  Comment: true altitude calculation =. QNH is higher than standard we have to add(+), if QNH is lower than standard we have to subtract (-)
ISA deviation is (-) we have to subtract(-) , ISA deviation is (+) we have to add
first find the QNH then ISA deviation
- Name: CarloRomaFlyPe
  Comment: and some one please help me
why now added to indicated altitude
- Name: SportingFr
  Comment: Isnt warmer than ISA and so deduct from 17 700ft? instead of adding
- Name: Pilott
  Comment: For those who get confused not knowing which correction to apply first remember PIT and its always in the same order P I T or the opposite T I P if we are given true altitude and asked for pressure altitude or indicated altitude

P = Pressure altitude which is a flight level ( Reference 1013)
I = Indicated altitude which is the altitude given when QNH set
T = True altitude
Since you are given a pressure altitude and asked for true altitude you can't jump from P (pressure) to T (true) directly you have to first find I (Indicated)

So basically apply the pressure correction from 1013 to the actual QNH to find the indicated altitude & then go for the temprature correction

Hope this helps

  Comment: TA = IA + (Isa dev x 4/1000 x IA)

TA = 17700 +(10 x 4/1000 x 17700) = 18408

Keep it simple :)
- Name: sebwis
  Comment: @Christopher well in this case that might be true, but if you consider a higher QNH difference that might not always be the case, especially if we have a lower than standard QNH.
- Name: Vukasin
  Comment: 18000 + 30 x (1003 - 1013) + (4/1000 x 10 x 17700) = 18408

I used this formula

PA + 30 x (QNH - Standard Pressure) + (4/1000 x ISA DEV x Height Difference)

Could someone tell me why this method is not favored by others? I used it in gnav quite a lot and it was always correct. I know that in some questions in Flight Planning the result might not be as close but it is close enough.
- Name: Michael1010
  Comment: Why do you calculate ISA deviation with 18 000ft and not with 17 700ft?
- Name: Richard
  Comment: What is the correct method, should we apply temperature correction first or the pressure correction?
I've seen a few questions where it is temperature correction first and then pressure correction, but here it is the other way around.

In met I remember it was pressure correction first???
- Name: StephEDW
  Comment: Step by step:
1. Determine ISA-Deviation: 15 degress - (18x2 degrees) = - 21 degrees (=ISA) --> ISA-Deviation +10

2. Convert PA (=FL) into IA (=QNH): QNH set 1013, actual QNH 1003 --> 10x30ft = 300 ft --> if you turn on your altimeter from 1013 to 1003, it will read less altitude, therefore: FL180-300ft= 17700ft

3. IA to TA: IA (QNH) + Temp Error (4x Height Above Surface/100 x ISA-Dev) = 17700 + (4x17700/100x10) = 17700+708 = 18408ft

  Comment: @atplq WHY WHY WHY sometimes you apply the pressure correction and THEN the temperature correction ? sometimes you do the opposite and depend on this we get different results!
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Federico, to find true altitude from indicated altitude first pressure correction should be done then the temperature correction. If you are given the true altitude, you should do temperature correction at the beginning and then pressure correction. Hope it helps!
- Name: Ellis
  Comment: I don't know how accurately they would want this in a type-in. But using the equation 4 x ISA Dev x (H/1000) with the numbers: 4 x 9.4 x 17.7 the dev I get is 665.5, giving me a final answer of 18365.5 Would this be within the acceptable bounds do you think? I prefer not to round unless it's MDR, as you can always argue a more accurate answer.
- Name: AndreCamacho
  Comment: why sometimes we apply the temperature correction on the given value and sometimes to the value corrected already with the pressure correction?
I did 4 x 10 x 18 = +720
but in the explanation you did 4 x 10 x 17.7 = 708
which is slightly different. And in other exercises we apply the correction to the given value like i did, can someone explain?
- Name: Alexx1215
  Comment: @ATPLQ In some questions you first correct by temperature and in other first by pressure, which is the correct method?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Alessandro, to get true altitude first apply pressure correction then temperature correction. This is the correct order or the reverse when we are trying to determine a proper flight level. There can be some mistakes in explanations, we will fix those. But in the end, usually the difference is very little and can be ignored.
- Name: Delife
  Comment: @ATPLQ I might be wrong but in the explanation it says that 17 700 is the pressure altitude whereas PA is the height above 1013, in this case 18 000. 17 000 would be the height above QNH so just altitude, right ?

- Name: Tetouanmag
  Comment: Had this question in my exam. The question is more something like : (something like that, but #transit clearance# is the important idea in the question and removes other options).

Moreover, i think one of the alicante TWR option is 4000ft, not 5000.

  Comment: @olivercairns Overflying the airport is when you are not entering the control zone, and most likely staying in the TMA. Crossing is when you are flying in the control zone (closer to the airport).
- Name: olivercairns
  Comment: @Olie2 what is the difference between overflight and crossing?
- Name: Olie2
  Comment: You have to OVERFLY the CTR, not CROSS it.
Overflying is between FL75 and 4500 ft. 5000ft is appropriate.
If you want to CROSS it, 1500ft is maximum. 1000ft would be appropriate.

  Comment: Hello, got yesterday a similar question but with a huge trap. The he cruise leg was in NAM without any clue about it.
We had to convert it to NGM and then do the calculation as in the question. There was also a lot parts of the trip to add to get the final result.
The question was asking for time between destination and alternate.
I don't remember the figure but the different steps were misse approach, cruise leg (in NGM but not mentioned, just XXX NM" ), descent, holding expected, approach and landing.
In the answers, 2 answers were possible one using NGM, one using NAM.
As the question was worth 2 points, I figured they wanted NAM to NGM because I had a similar question worth 1 point with only one possible answer using NGM like here.

  Comment: @codfather You can not "rely" (as per theory) on EDSA airfield because it's a GRASS runway (green inside the blue circle), it could (AND WILL) blend with the terrain.
I've flown all my flight hours in the "country side" and quite often I found myself struggling to differentiate grass runways and fields.. I personally would have used the mast as it's high and easy to spot, or I'd have "diverted" up to the mast (3563') east of Besingen, north/west of EDSA.
- Name: codfather
  Comment: Why not the airfiled? Perfect location for turning and avoiding the restricted airspace, they ask which is a suitable point to start turning, not to fly towards. The way the question is built makes one thing that the aircraft departs straight from EDMC to EDTS and, somewhere along the way, we must find a suitable point to start a turn in order to avoid restricted airspace.

Then do the same from EDMC to the mast to EDTS.
The question states that we want to go in the most DIRECT manner. You can clearly see that from EDSA to EDTS you will still pass through the restricted area if you follow the most direct manner. If you go to the mast, you will avoid that area.

Are they saying, that we fly direct to the mast and then turn??

- Name: Cintra
  Comment: Correct me if im wrong, but from what I've learned:

IFR charts themselves are still oriented to TRUE north, rather airways, radials, etc., are in MAGNETIC.

In other words, when taking a bearing in reference to a meridian, you get true. When taking a bearing in reference to an airway or radial, you get magnetic.
- Name: Mariel
  Comment: Could you please explanation why the conversion is needed at all, since many students are already asking? Also, is "initial" referring to the chlong as it is in GNAV? The explanation is not that clear as it is.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello all! There seems to be some confusion around this question, and charts in general which I will try to address.
Latitude and Longitude are referenced to Geographic or True North. Whenever we measure the angle between two points on a chart relative to a line of longitude, we are measuring the True Direction. This is true for the gridlines on every aeronautical chart (unless referenced to "grid North" but this is now outside the scope of ATPL Theory).
Airways are usually provided as Magnetic Headings. Similarly, the rose placed around VORs on charts is aligned to Magnetic North. On this chart, there is no rose OR airway to or from either NAVAID from which we can measure the angle. The best reference we have is a line of longitude (008ºW), which points to True North. There is, conveniently, a closeby Isogonal which gives us a fairly accurate idea of the variation from where we are measuring the heading.
Due to convergence (covered in General Navigation), the True Heading will be different at Keflavik. The variation will also be different at Keflavik. We are asked to determine the Magnetic Heading at Benbecula, so measure it here on the chart, and use the local variation. We could also measure this at Keflavik using the chart in the exact same manner - measure the angle against a local line of longitude and then apply the variation at that point.
As such, the current explanation is correct and provides the quickest and most accurate way to approach this question using the knowledge you should learn from Flight Planning only. I hope this is helpful!

  Comment: @tomasao by using our plot on the chart, the number we get is automatically the true bearing. the matter you're referring to is the fact that that the heading given by the chart between two waypoints (not the one calculated by us) is magnetic.
- Name: Julez
  Comment: Chart states: Grid Bearing = True Bearing.
We want Magnetic Bearing.
-> CDMVT Rule (from T back to M)
West variation: from left to right "-" and opposite direction "+"
East variation: -> "+" and <- "-"
So we have to add the West variation.

Hope it helps.

  Comment: Saw exactly what @agusbin is describing in AUSTRO SPAIN. I cant find anything similar in the bank.
- Name: Muhammedkasem
  Comment: There is a clear contradiction between the two explanations regarding the calculation of additional fuel in CFS scenarios. The first question 338615 and its explanation state that only the smallest difference between CFS and OBF should be used, covering the nearest alternate only. However, this question requires the highest difference, covering all critical points. Unless the operational policy or the question specifically requires coverage of all critical scenarios, the correct application per EASA AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.181 is to use the minimum required for the closest suitable alternate. Please clarify and ensure consistency.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Muhammedkasem.
Question 338615: Smallest difference between CFS and OBF
In this case, the question presents two alternate airport scenarios, but you are only required to plan for reaching one alternate, not both. So, to determine additional fuel, you only need to ensure you can reach the closer alternate.
Therefore, the correct method here is to take the smallest difference between the Off-Block Fuel (OBF) and the Critical Fuel Scenario (CFS), because that represents the least extra fuel needed to safely reach the required alternate.
Question 338327: Largest difference from multiple critical points (ETPs)
This question is different in nature. It involves two critical points (ETPs) along the route. Each ETP is assessed independently in terms of whether, at that specific point, you would have enough fuel to safely divert, hold, and land.
In this case, the correct approach is to calculate the required additional fuel at each ETP and then take the largest difference. Why? Because you don’t know at which point the emergency may occur, and you need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.
I hope this makes sense!
- Name: Muhammedkasem
  Comment: There appears to be a clear contradiction in the way additional fuel is calculated between two q in the bank.
• In question 338615, the explanation specifically states that we should select the smallest difference between the Critical Fuel Scenario (CFS) and Off-Block Fuel (OBF), i.e., the minimum additional fuel required.
• However, in the question above, no such clarification is given, and the answer expects us to use the largest difference.

Both q ask about the “additional fuel requirement” based on the OBF and CFS, but the application is inconsistent. Could you please clarify which method is correct and ensure consistency across the database?

Thank you!

If you are flying over the ocean and you are approaching your last ETP before leaving the ETOPS area, you may need less fuel to reach your destination than the last alternate airport.

  Comment: @Luke6 you are great how do you know this thing
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @DPERD @Luke6 has explained it very well. In Q338615, there are 2 alternates and each one has 1 CFS. Since we are only required by law to reach one alternate, we only have to have enough fuel for one of the CFS. This is why in Q338615, you choose the smallest difference between CFS and OBF.
In Q338327, you only have 1 alternate aerodrome. Along this route, there are 2 CFS so you must have enough fuel for both CFS to ensure that you can make the alternate aerodrome safely. As such you must take the larger difference to cover for both CFS.
- Name: DPERD
  Comment: This sais the opposite than Q338615, please clarify.
- Name: Luke6
  Comment: Hi all, I tried to find the difference between the two similar questions in the bank and might've found something:

Q338615 - "2 Alternates & smallest difference

This question states that we have 2 alternates whereas the legal requirement is only 1.
This means that you can take the smallest value corresponding to the closest alternate aerodrome to your route based on the legal requirement (and possibly use that extra gain of mass for other reasons such as more passengers, bags, etc)

Q338327 - "2 Critical Points" & larger difference

This question is similar but has one major difference which is that we consider 2 CRITICAL points along our route for only 1 alternate aerodrome (as opposed to 2 in the previous question).
Critical points indicate how much fuel you would need in different scenarios if you were faced with an emergency scenario. Here we have 2 of these, thus if we were to face any of the two, we would prefer to face the worst-case scenario in which you would need the most fuel and take the largest difference between the 2 values.

That's how I see the way to resolve these 2 questions and hopefully, it helps!

  Comment: for this kind of questions, how can we be sure that we don't need to convert to NAM first? Thanks for your help! :-)
- Name: Cano2020
  Comment: it should be actual 15 kg, instead of 47, they are asking us for the new Fuel with 140 kt of TAS, so if we would fly with 130 kt we would still have a HWC of 25 kt, therefore our GS will be 105.

So 166NM / 105 kt = 1,58 h x 162 kg/h = 256 kg
166 NM / 115 = 1,44h x 188 = 271 kg
a increase of 15 kg
- Name: YounesSebbouba
  Comment: @Ranieri, more simple way for me :

Planned TAS : 130 kts
Planned HWC : -10kts
FF @ 130kts = 162 kg /h

--> Time = Distance / Speed

Planned TAS to Planned GS : 130 - 10 = 120

Time = 166 / 120 = 1.38 at this point no need to convert anything just continue working as :

FF = 162kg/h so fuel needed for 166 nm = 162 x 1.38 = 223.56

Now, we'll work the actual TAS and Forecast :

GS : 140 kts - 25 kts = 115
T = 166/115 = 1.44
FF @ 140 TAS = 188
188 x 1.44 = 270.72

Additional fuel required : 270.72 - 223.5 = 47.22 Kg
- Name: Ranieri
  Comment: forecast:
tas= 130kt-> ff= 162 kg/h -> 2,7 kg/ min
forecast wind= 10head wind -> gs= 130-10= 120kt
to cover 166nm with gs of 120 we need:
166nm/120kt= 1h 23min, which is equal to 80min. so forecast fuel is:
80x2.7= 224,1 kg

actual:
but the actual wind is different, so:
to compensate we fly at 140 tas
tas= 140kt-> ff= 188 kg/h -> 3,13 kg/min
with actual wind of 25 kt head wind.
tas-head wind=gs -> 140-25= 115 kt
to cover the same distance(166nm) at 115 kt we need:
166/115= 1h 26min which is equal to 86min
fo actual consume fuel is:
86x3,13= 269,18kg

we just find the difference btw the forecast consume fuel to actual consume fuel which is:

269,18-224,1= 45,08 kg more

therefore, we need to take the given MORA (16200) and subtract 2000', leaving us with 14,200'.

- Name: SlavovYani
  Comment: You should calculate temp deviation for AIR COLUMN, so we need to start with QNH not 1013 for ISA deviation. And the we get 17000 -390= 16610ft - 13500ft = 3110ft. This is AIR COLUMN for temperature calculations.
- Name: 777umaid
  Comment: 1- Remove the clearance from MIN GRID ALT as it AUTO applied So = 14200

Do not use clearance as well with FL 170

2- Get the Indicated .
ISA DEV = -10
3- Get the TRUE

True = 16485.6
Now clearance is TRUE - MIN GRID ALT = 2285.6 ft
- Name: Hossein123
  Comment: Just so you know when to add things and subtract after using the figure in the explanation:

P. Alt is using 1013. If we want to change it to an Indicated Alt. of 1000 hpa. Just think of what you would do in the plane, you turn the knob down from 1013 to 1000 and you can see the altitude indication dropping. So 1013-1000 = 13. 13 x 30 = 390. We subtract the P. Alt of 17'000ft by 390 to get an I. Alt of 16610.

Now for the temperature corrections, remember Cold Kills, because your P.Alt lies to you and says you are at 17000ft but in reality your True Altitude is lower, hence the cold kills bit. So if you are going from P.Alt to True Alt. you subtract your temp. correction to the P.Alt to get True Alt.

- Name: Faizan
  Comment: Not sure if this is correct way but it worked for me

TA= PA+30(QNH-1013)+(4/1000 x ISA DEV x column of air between airport elevation and ALT)

ISA Dev : -10 (15-(2x17) = -19 actual temp -29)
Column of air : 3500 (17000-13500)

Apply formula
17000+30(1000-1013)+(4/1000 x -10 x 35000) = 16500

Moca 16200 - 2000 feet clearance = 14200

16500-14200= 2300 ~ Ans 2286

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL). In this case, the airfield elevation is said to be 13 500 ft, and it must be taken into account for the temperature correction.
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

  Comment: Isnt the temperature correction applied for the air between aircraft and terrain?
If we are flying at F170 (minus the pressure correction = 16.610ft) and Grid MORA 16200 (with 2000ft obstacle clearance), it leaves us with: 16610 - 16200 = 410ft + 2000ft = 2410ft to apply ISA deviation to.

Why are you using station elevation? Or am I missing something?

  Comment: I know the order causes a lot of confusion but, for me, finding some logic in it helped. - We can only apply the temp. correction to the height between the AC and the reporting station. This is the most important rule. So we have to do the following: When the question wants the True Altitude: Apply Pressure correction first, Temp. correction second. When the question wants the Pressure Altitude / FL: Apply Temp. correction first, Pressure correction second. To Summarise: For TA: P first, T second. For PA: T first, P second.

  Comment: Minimum Grid Altitude (MGA)
MGA represents the lowest safe altitude which can be flown off-track.
The MGA is calculated by rounding up the elevation of the highest obstruction within the respective grid area to the next 100ft and adding an increment of
1000ft for terrain or obstructions up to 6000ft or
2000ft for terrain or obstructions above 6000ft.
e.g. 6345ft obstacle = 6400ft rounded up + 2000ft buffer = 8400ft MGA Shown in hundreds of feet. Lowest indicated MGA is 2000ft.
This value is also provided for terrain and obstacles that would result in an MGA below 2000ft. Exception is over water areas where the MGA can be omitted.
- Name: peko
  Comment: @ATPLQ
You didn't apply the pressure correction first in your explanation that is why the result is different.

Indicated altitude 17000 , pressure difference =13HPA x 30 ft = 390 ft
Altitude corrected for pressure difference = 16610 ft
Height of the parcel of air for the temperature correction = 16610-13500=3110 ft
Isa deviation -10 degrees
Temperature correction =0.04 x 3110=124 ft
True altitude= 16610-124ft=16486 ft
Grid area altitude provides 2000ft of clearance so the highest obstacle is at 16200-2000=14200 ft
Clearance = True altitude-highest possible obstacle= 16486 - 14200 = 2286 ft

When calculating the TRUE altitude with the indicated altitude given (FL), apply the pressure correction first then the temperature correction to the height of the parcel of air adjusted for the pressure deviation.
When calculating the indicated altitude and knowing the true altitude (clearance or obstacle) , the order in which the corrections are made does not matter .
In the CAA there are type in questions so you need to be precise with your answer.
- Name: ATRpilot
  Comment: Why EASA can't provide the mathematically correct answer is beyond me. Going through your calculation only to be left with an answer which doesn't match any of the options is a dirty move and leaves students doubting themselves and, in some instances, going back and changing what was a perfectly good method. This obtuse 'closest answer' BS should be stopped as it needlessly costs us time and points..

  Comment: Can someone explain which order we do calculations in. Some questions apply temperature correction first, some apply pressure correction first. Thank you.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Marcus, to get true altitude first apply pressure correction then temperature correction. This is the correct order or the reverse when we are trying to determine a proper flight level. But in the end, the difference is very little even if the correct order is not used rarely leads to a mistake. Order is corrected.

- Name: Daniel
  Comment: I already have a problem. somebody explain in human terms when he subtracts and when he adds, for example, the W or E declension
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Daniel if you are referring to the variation, here's the explanation : 
To get the true heading, you need to first read the magnetic compass, then either add an Easterly, or subtract a Westerly, magnetic variation; based on the isogonic lines.
When converting true to magnetic heading, you’d do the opposite and subtract an Easterly, or add a Westerly, magnetic variation. This is where the saying East is least, West is best stems from.
Hope it helps!
- Name: Figo
  Comment: @Daniel, the magnetic track from GASKO to OBOXA is 150, but the question asks for reciprocal track OBOXA to GASKO, which is 150 + 180 = 330 magnetic track. We’re asked for the true track, which is 328 because right next to Gasko you can read a variation of 2W. Magnetic Track 330 equals true track 328.

Hope this helps.

  Comment: why plus 180?

  Comment: easy question,if you see 150 near Gasko,150 plus 180 is equal 330 minus 2W is on left of Gasko ... 328

  Comment: Overlay:
Follows the same path as a conventional procedure, but flown using GPS/RNAV instead of ground-based navaids.

Bypass:
A new GPS route that avoids or replaces the old conventional path for better efficiency.

Overlay = same path, new tech
Bypass = new path, new route

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @ilsenatore92. The published NAVAIDs for the procedure must be operational and you must monitor the navigation information from them. RNAV overlay procedures allow you to use RNAV system to navigate along SIDs (and STARs) which are otherwise defined by ground-based NAVAIDs. I hope this answers your question!

- Name: Timothy
  Comment: @Babgon94 How could 1a) ever be lower than 2)?
- Name: Babgon94
  Comment: For the minimum fuel for reciprocating engines in isolated aerodromes you compare:

The *greater* of 1) and 2):
. . 1) The lesser of a) and b):
. . . . .a) 45min + 15% Time in Cruise, or
. . . . .b) 2 H time in cruise
. . 2) Fuel to fly 45 min

So for example, in this question:

The *greater* of 1) and 2) is 820 kg, since:
. . 1) The lesser of a) and b) is approx. 820 kg, since:
. . . . .a) (45min + 15% Time in Cruise) x 780 kg/h = 819 kg (approx. 820 kg)
. . . . .b) 2 H time in cruise x 780 kg/h = 1560 kg
. . 2) Fuel to fly 45 min x 780 kg/h = 585 kg (approx. 590 kg)

  Comment: **Final Reserve Fuel is included in PDP Fuel.**
**CONT Fuel may be used up inflight and not required when overhead DEST**
..
For reciprocating engine, PDP fuel is the LOWER of:
1) 45 min + 15% CRZ: 45 min + (2hr x 15%) = 63 min
2) 2 hr: 120 min

Therefore, PDP Fuel = 63min x 780kg/hr = 819kg

  Comment: @Jake201002 The additional fuel for isolated aerodromes INCLUDES the final reserve fuel
- Name: Jake201002
  Comment: The additional fuel of 819 makes sense. However you should surely be overhead with that and your final reserve, which in this case would be 45 minutes worth of fuel consumption as its a reciprocating engine. So should it not be 819 (additional) + 585 (Final reserve) to give 1404?

  Comment: UK CAA, 1/4/2021

asked for contingency and stated "to find holding fuel flow you can use final reserve."

I multiplied the final reserve fuel by 2 to get the holding fuel flow, because FR= 30 mins of holding for jet which also means half of the holding fuel flow is the final reserve fuel.

then I did 5% of trip fuel and 5 mins of holding ff and found that the 5% is the bigger number so I went for it, was around 242.
type in btw.

goodluck.

From personal experience, unless the question text specifically states "En-route Alternate/ERA" available, this should not be assumed and a contingency of 5% shall be used. Hope this helps!

  Comment: 37.5 / 250 * 60 = 9
- Name: DrPilot
  Comment: Basic speed formula.
Velocity = Distance : Time

250kt (as written in up-right corner box) = 37.5NM (17nm molix-lutex + 13nm lutex-robvi + 7.5nm robvi-sugol) : TIME
37.5NM : 250KT = 9 minutes

If it is displayed as 0.15 in your calculations, just hit the "degrees/hours-minutes-seconds" (usually circla and 3 commas) button and it will give you 0h9min0sec.

simply - align the 60 min/h mark with 250 kt, then scroll to the calculated 37.5 NM.

  Comment: UK CAA (Remember to come back and mark as seen after your exams). @atpl fuel actual at Dep was 3000. Estimated at 2400. Actual at B 2300. ATO at B 12:10. Distance for B 300. Distance for A 150.
- Name: Nou
  Comment: Work with the actual numbers.

Actual time between Departure and point B is= 12'14'-11'40'=0'34'. So, the time between departure and point B is 34 minutes.

The distance at point be is 150NM, meaning you covered this distance in 34 minutes, so get the Ground Speed. GS= 150/34 minutes= 264.70 Ground Speed.

The distance at point C is 300 NM. Since we are using the same conditions, we will use our Ground Speed to get how long we will be able to cover this distance. To get the time we will 300/264.70= 1 Hour and 8 Minutes. Add this time to the Actual time at point B ( which is given in the table) = 1'8'+12'14'= 13'22'

To calculate the Fuel flow, simply get the difference between the Departure and fuel remaining at point B= 2800- 2290 = 510 was burned, and since we already calculated that the time to cover between the departure and point B is 34 minutes, so we will get how much fuel we burn per minute by 510/34=15 lbs per minute.

We have also got that at point C we will cover this distance at 1 Hour and 8 minutes or 68 minutes, so to get how much fuel we will burn at point C we will 15*68=1020 lb will be burned. Subtract 1020 from the Actual fuel remaining at point B 2290-1020= 1270 lb fuel remaining.

  Comment: Misleading question. Have to remember Estimated values are updated throughout the flight when you get new 'real life' data.

Using actual values can see that 150 miles was travelled in 34 minutes => speed = 265 kts

300 miles (leg distance not accumulated distance :/) will take 68 minutes.

1214 + 68 minutes = 1322

Fuel flow = 900 lbs per hour

900/60 x 68 = 1020 lbs

2290 - 1020 = 1270 lbs remaining

- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: appeal. the annex says clearly . before reaching or at NE SE SW. so i can accept the supposition that the pilot will not get through SE since he comes from SW and then wants to go S, but the answer then should be AT SW, not before arriving at SW. because like this you are saying that the pilot is not allowed to contact frequency when AT SW, which is not true.

  Comment: Same question today in Latvia CAA just it was more clear because they noted that aircraft was approaching near the coast from south west.
- Name: piperguy66
  Comment: Guys I think the real answer lies in the Route Description ..
it states " South Route REP SW - S " and NOT SE (basically SE is not a reporting point according to the chart ) ..
REP stands for Report

Silly question
- Name: Murat
  Comment: None of the answers states "at or before", so by just looking at the chart, you can see that contacting ATC AT SE would be to late, you would enter ATZ without getting clearance in time.
- Name: FREEOFATPLSHACKLES
  Comment: I'll trust ATPLQ's answer but this question is bad. If you approach from South you can be near the coast either at point SW or SE both are near the coast, the question needs to specify which portion of the coast we're on. Would 200% appeal this .

I'm sick of this crap from Easa. It's absolute no bearing on real life ops. Remember it and move on sadly. 2 correct answers and its' solely down to your interpretation on the day along with what kind of mood the person who sets the question is in.
- Name: Jakub
  Comment: Why DAN has so many thumbs up? It's clearly written in 19-3 in arrivals ".. shall establish radio contact with Alicante twr AT or BEFORE reaching VFR REPs..". And again EASA.... the more correct answer to "near the coast" is SW because it's closer to coast than SE.
- Name: Loris
  Comment: @atplquestions why "prior entering atz" is wrong? in the aerodrome information chart is written explicitly that aircrafts should contact the arc before arriving at REPs

Question Number: AT00094
- Name: Muhammedkasem
  Comment: Guys, just a heads-up: since the question clearly states that its not possible to land back at the departure aerodrome due to weather conditions, having a take-off alternate is mandatory ( option A). Also, you always need to have a destination alternate (option C). So, in this case, option A is definitely the correct choice, I compared these 2 options
- Name: Michiels177
  Comment: the correct answer was literally the first option I disregarded -.-
- Name: RotorBoat
  Comment: so, the take-off alternate is an alternate you can fly to after T/O should the need arise
if im understanding the question right, it states that the "take-off alternate" is the destination aerodrome?

man that melted my brain. what a load of shakespeare just to say you're flying to your destination airport lmao

- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: @SkrrrrtPapa in my country you can appeal the question if, in your opinion there s something wrong with it. from a wrong answer, to a poor wording issue that leads to misleading questions or even if the results are too close together and dont take into account for approximations. The fact that you dont know if the question is valid or not wont make a difference. if it was valid, your appeal is negated. in the other hand, if they see you have a point, they might set your question as correct. in my last exam i appealed 4 questions and for 3 of them i was right. this increased my score from 86% to 91%. so i always suggest to appeal questions whenever they are doubtful. remember that it is your right to go against poorly made exam questions. and EASA exams are FULL of appealable questions. these are my 2cents obv. so you feel free to follow up or not. (also this question in particular appeared written differently from how it is here. that s why it s important also to know when to appeal if you know how the question should be written)
- Name: GhaithGarraoui
  Comment: The only case you can avoid the need for additional fuel is if your destination is closer than any other suitable aerodrome and is within the regulatory take off alternate distance (1 hour cruise time at the OEI or ETOPS diversion time).
- Name: SkrrrrtPapa
  Comment: @Typhoon you say appeal to many questions. How do you know if it was wrong on the exam? You dont get feedback on questions. Appeal to what?
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: appeal for terrible wording. plus it has conflicting feedback based on authority.
if it was written better i would agree on needing a take off alternate. but it is hard to depct the situation with such a poor wording

  Comment: What if A is Heathrow and B is Sydney? I aint putting Heathrow as my alternate.. the route distance matters.
- Name: GhaithGarraoui
  Comment: What "need for additional fuel" is avoided when your T/O alternate is your destination? Is this only valid when your destination AD is within one hour at the OEI and is the nearest available AD? Because if it's further than another available AD, you need to choose that available AD without the need for additional fuel. I mean, usually, there is no need for additional fuel for a T/O alternate, right?

  Comment: check question 333572

There you say that if headwind increases, the FMS will compensate by increasing speed.
Here you say the ETA will fall behind. Why does it fall behind, why is it not maintained?

Any inputs?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @PaulVlad, thank you for your comment. These two questions indeed seem contradictory, but the problem is not in this question but in question 333572. On question 333572 we received comments similar to the one you also stated. Our response to the comments on that question is as follows:
"As a Boeing 737 pilot myself, I must admit that I have some reservations about the currently accepted correct option. However, it has been reported by students that this answer was deemed correct in their exams. In such cases, I would encourage you to challenge this question if you encounter it in your own examinations.
Now, let's discuss the behavior of the Flight Management System (FMS) when there is a variance between the actual wind and the wind entered into the FMS:
If the FMS detects a difference in wind, it will calculate a new optimal speed based on the updated wind data and the entered cost index. However, this adjustment is applicable only when the VNAV mode is set to ECON. If a fixed speed is selected, the FMS will continue flying at that speed regardless of the wind conditions. In such cases, the FMS will continuously recalculate the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) based on the current time, position, actual wind for the current leg, and inserted winds for other legs.
Most FMS systems provide a feature that allows pilots to reach a specific waypoint at a predetermined ETA. When this mode is activated, the FMS will continuously recalculate and adjust the speed to achieve the desired ETA at the specified waypoint. It's worth noting that this mode is not a standard operating mode."

Question Number: AT00100
- Name: Matti
  Comment: BGS has exactly the same question and set of answers - word by word. But the correct answer is "There will be no effect as the FMC will make an automatic correction". Who to believe? Throw a coin and pray..
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Matti... interesting! The FMC uses the cruise altitude to compute optimum speeds (e.g., ECON speed), fuel flow estimates, estimated time of arrival (ETA), step climbs or descents. Therefore, if the cruise level is entered incorrectly, these calculations will be based on wrong assumption. We believe our current correct answer is the correct one. If anyone comes across this question in their exam, please let us know. Thank you!
- Name: Giordan886
  Comment: you have to assume that you're still on the ground doing planning and briefing, in flight if you select on MCP a lower FL then the FMC will adjust time and fuel flow based on the current data.
- Name: Pietro
  Comment: Enac today, watch out bupecause there was a lot of poor structured questions that didint have correct answer including this, in the exam there wasnt a correct answer like here unfortunately
- Name: FlyingLegend
  Comment: You are all right, the FMC will compute the right values for the entered altitude or flight level, BUT let's say you plan with FL350, but accidently type FL360 in the FMC and don't recognise the wrong level. So before the flight the FMC will calculate values that are wrong for you, but right for the level you typed in, inflight the FMC would then correct the values according to the actual flight level.
Take for example a fuel calculation from FPL: Let's say you have a trip fuel of 6450kg and want to calculate the 5% contigency, but you type in 6540kg instead. Your calculation is still correct, but the result is not.
The question is a bit tricky to understand
- Name: ricardgalisteo
  Comment: A computer is never wrong, it does whatever it is told to. If you ask FL400, you will get FL400, even if you wanted to put FL300. This question is bs like almost all the bank of this subject made buy a bunch of chimpanzees and failed careers that can't even use commas or comprehend basic language.
People say meteo is ambiguous, but it was not half bad as this subject is. At least half the questions are made by professional meteorologists, not like this clown subject.

  Comment: ULC POLAND 6.04 slightly reworded, but correct answer similar to one in
- Name: Pipinho
  Comment: This aint true. The wording is terrible. If the planned flight level should be FL350 and the pilot instead inserts FL370 it will give the wright values for the FL370 however it wont give you the values you where expecting on flight planning however the calculations it does for the FL370 are still coprrect.
- Name: Malgorzata
  Comment: I can confirm that answer A is correct in polish CAA -ULC
- Name: Oleksandr
  Comment: Depends on phase. FMC will 100% sure make a correction, but only in flight. On FLIGHT PLANNING phase -> speed/fuel/time calculation will be according to the inserted FL. Most probably, EASA assumed the answer should be respectful to the name of the subject))

faultybird: It' jusEASAfied, it's only by just 10ft.
- Name: mariokart
  Comment: I have another way.

1) 1030-1013 = 17 x 30 = 510ft
2) 3500 elev. - 510 = 2990 ft (because we're going from qnh to qne)
3) 25.000 - 2990 = 22010 ft

closest answer 22000
- Name: omer
  Comment: TA = PA + 30 (QNH-1013)
TA = 25000 + 30 (1030-1013) = 25510
clearance = TA - elevation = 25510 - 3500 = 22010

closest answer 22000

- Name: DannyTheRaccoon
  Comment: Agree with Arrow! Without the question saying at which point we are cleared to FL330 from 6000ft, there is NO WAY you can possibly find a definitive answer instead of just guessing like you did. If anything, you should consider the whole SID procedure up to ANDIK to be flown at 6000ft, and the climb to FL330 to only start from there (without additional information, this is surely what the question sounded to me!)

The question states we will only use 8/15mins of Additional Fuel, so no need for an emergency as we have enough. If it is worth 3 points, it's a steal and make sure you all know this question by heart. Usually 3 points are given for Extra Fuel calculations etc.

  Comment: Fuel rules have to be changed in order to consider that tankering has anything to do with weather below minimuns at destination. The question is a wrong joke.
- Name: JamesRayner
  Comment: The reason for 2 being correct is that you don't mind having extra fuel in the event of a diversion.

Since the weather is below minima, you may need to go to your alternate. In that case, it would actually be nice to have the extra fuel

Number 4 is probably quite obvious so no explanation needed there

Good luck guys :)

  Comment: @DRU1024 If you load your extra fuel without taking into account the contingency burn, the fuel you loaded will potentially not meet the requirements of the minimum block fuel for the EIDW-LFPG leg (7100kg) as the contingency burn could've been used, and will end up not being accounted for.

It's a very awful assumption for a question like this, unfortunately. If you assume worst-case fuel burn for this scenario, it should help you push through this question!

  Comment: (1) tof at lfpg minus taxi,trip,contmin
5226-230-2933-157 = 1906kg of fuel in your tanks when you land at eidw

(2) you need to take off with 7100 at eidw so:
7100-1906 = 5194 kg EXTRA that you need to add when you take off at lfpg

(3) also fuel penalty is 60kg more fuel per 1000 extra
(5194/1000)*60 = 312kg

(4) add fuel penalty
5194+312 = 5506 kg total extra fuel

- Name: Schlugoo
  Comment: I had a question like this but nothing to calculate. Just theory. Austro Control 30.08.24

You plan a flight from Athen to Paris and back. Due to refueling problems in Paris, you decide to take fuel for the flight Paris-Athen on the outbound leg, so that no fueling is necessary in Paris.

What do you expect?
A.) The fuel consumption will be less from Paris to Athen
B.) The take off mass Paris - Athens increases
C.) The CO2 emission will increase on the outbound leg Athen-Paris
D.) You expect no change

I chose option C.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Schlugoo. We have added a new question based on the information you've shared: 337896. Thank you for your feedback.
- Name: Nmaca64
  Comment: How I did it:
We need to be at the gate in Dublin with 7100 kg. So what do we need in Paris to achieve that? That and everything we reasonably expect to burn: definitely taxi and trip, and contingency. So we need 7100+230+2933+157 = 10420kg at the stand in Paris. We have planned 5226kg, so that means we want to tanker 10420 - 5226 = 5194 kg.
THEN don't miss the extra step of fuel penalty for tankering! We need to add 60 kg per 1000 kg extra, which brings you to 5505.4 kg
- Name: ViktorS
  Comment: KermitTheSnitch

Before solving this question, take a sip of coffee and relax, cause its quite simple, once you get it ;-)

1) Knowing that our planned fuel in the first leg is 5226 kg, we subtract taxi, trip and contingency = 1906 kg (fuel after landing at EIDW).
2) Our fuel needed for the return is 7100 kg --> 7100 - 1906 = 5194.
3) The fuel penalty is 60 kg per 1000 kg. Just divide 5194 with 1000, and multiply the answer with 60, which is 311.64.

Add 5194 and 311.64 together and you will get 5505.64! :-D
It just requires some patience and practice, and you will get there.
Good luck!

- Name: Talisa
  Comment: Hi there,
I am not convinced on the correct answer and the explanation. The explanation assumes the worst case on the flight LFPG-EIDW by fully consuming the contingency. Would the worst case not that we also assume an additional holding at EIDW and end up at EIDW with a remaining final reserve fuel only? With this assumption we would remain with 914 kg on board only at EIDW and a need of 7100 kg for the EIDW-LFPG leg. This would bring us to additional 6186kg required + penalty (672kg) = +7458Kg.

We will add this question to our database but we need more details about it. We don't want to randomly change other fuel quantities to add a new question with the answer 2972 kg, because this new question would not be the same as the one you all encountered anyway, only the answers would be the same.

- Name: Nivatierrez
  Comment: Same as Aurel in Spain, another numbers and the correct answer is 2972
- Name: Pepperoni69
  Comment: I solved it this way:

1) determine the fuel that is gonna be burned btw LFPG-EIDW. We need to take into account the contingency because, in case we don't assume is used and, for some reason we need it, we are below the minimum fuel for the return flight.
The total fuel that we are gonna burn on the first leg so is 230+2933+157=3320kg.
2) for the return leg, EIDW-LFPG we need 7100kg, as stated by the flight plan, but we'll have in our tanks also the fuel we didn't burn for the first leg (5226-3320=1906kg), so actually we don't need to take with us 7100kg for the return leg because we are gonna have also the 1906kg we didn't burn for the leg LFPG-EIDW.
3) Considering the above, the fuel we need to additionally put in our tanks is the difference btw the fuel required from EIDW-LFPG and the fuel we are not gonna burn on the leg LFPG-EIDW, so 7100-1906= 5194kg
4) to this 5194kg we need to add the fuel penalty to carry them, we are gonna take the penalty of the first leg as we need to carry them from LFPG to Eidw. As a result we have [(5194/1000) x 60] + 5194 = 5506.

hope it helps guys!

We need for T/O from B to C 7100 kg (target fuel).. Then, Target fuel - Landing fuel = 5194 kg, BUUUT we need to add the fuel penalty! adding the 69 kg per 1000 kg, 5194 + 358 = 5552 kg (close enough)

  Comment: new question

New question for flight planning seen 07/11/2023 for Austro control in Spain.

An aircraft is flying along a true course of 276 and the actual wind is different than the forecast wind. The forecast wind is 240/15 and the actual wind is 290/25. The airspeed remains the same. Which statements are correct or incorrect?

1) The lower ground speed will result in a later time of arrival.
2) The wind correction angle will change from a value to the right to a value to the left.

Answer was 1) Correct and 2) Incorrect

Worded alongs the lines of this

  Comment: Seen Austro Spain 7/11/23 , although different values for fuel and answer was 2972kg, if I remember correctly. I can confirm that they want you to assume you have used your contingency fuel. The working out is exactly how the explanation is but just different numbers so make sure you know how to work it out, 2 pointer
- Name: easadepression
  Comment: In my opinion the contingency fuel burn in the explanation is irrelevant and has no reasons to be done. Is A T P L q making explanations to match the answer..?

Don't do the part with contingency and the answer will be 5339,2 which is the closest to the right one.
- Name: pierinocolombo
  Comment: First, to solve this question you have to stop complaining, now, taking the most important step, we begin to solve:

1) Knowing that our planned fuel in the first leg is 5226 kg, we subtract taxi, trip and contingency = 1906 kg (fuel after landing at EIDW).

2) Our fuel needed for the return is 7100 kg --> 7100 - 1906 = 5194.

3) The fuel penalty is 60 kg per 1000 kg, or in simpler numbers --> 6 kg per 100 kg. 5194 x 1.06 = 5505.4

I hope that helps :)
- Name: sidalmukhtar
  Comment: It is easy but the explanation is a way too complicated

You will land with 1906 KG after burning taxi trip and contingency so you need to fill 5194 to meet the required fuel for the return and since there is penalty on refueling which 60 kelo for each 1000 kg 5194*1.06= 5505.64 kg

  Comment: general feedback for everybody with Austro Control:

Unfortunately FPL was not banky at all. However it is still easy to pass as long as you are well prepared.
Out of 42 questions I knew 6 or 7 from and some of them have not been reported at Austro before.

The exam itself was very similar to GNAV.
More than half of all question were Flight/Aviation Computer questions -->finding W/V with heading given; find revised ground speed; find new ETAs with changed wind and so on.

About 80% of all questions were calculations - only very little theory.

Advise for Austro:
-make sure you are confident using the Flight Computer
-practice flight log questions
-take a look at the recently reported questions the morning before the exam just for short term memory.

Good luck !
- Name: ChrisScholl
  Comment: Okay, so after working through this question again and again, I came to a conclusion which should help (at least me) to solve this question..
1. they are asking us to have the target fuel (7100 kgs) on board when returning, so this is the amount of fuel we should have when arriving at EIDW
2. We intend to land at EIDW (if we would have to use the alternate we wouldn't care about the tankering anymore, so consider the reserve & alternate fuel untouched @EIDW). To get to EIDW we burn from our block fuel the taxi fuel, the trip fuel and we also consider having burnt the contingency fuel to be on the safe side if we really would need to use it.
3. So we arrive with 1906 kgs on board
4. Find the difference to target fuel to find out how much fuel we need to tanker to get our target fuel @EIDW and correct it for the increased fuel burn via the 60kgs/1000kgs at LFPG

I know for some this question might seem easy but i struggled a lot, maybe it helped someone else, too
Good Luck @ the exam :)

  Comment: SENASA SPAIN, answer 5506
- Name: Balkanpilot
  Comment: Why are we taking into account Extra fuel at EIDW? The question clearly states MINIMUM fuel. If I am the pilot on that flight I would've fuelled up 4265 kg of fuel (without 1014 kg of extra fuel). If that Extra fuel is necessary for any reason it should be stated in the question otherwise it is not needed in my opinion since we have enough final reserve fuel and alternate fuel.
- Name: Javier
  Comment: When you land at EIDW you need to read 7100kg on the fuel indicator.

1- So, you departed from LFPG with 5226kg but you will burn the taxi and trip fuel (2933+230=3163kg), so substract to know what you have remaining, 5226-3163=2063kg.

2- You have 2063kg remaining but you wanted 7100kg so substract to know the extra fuel you need to add before departing, 7100-2063=5037kg. Thats it, you have the extra fuel you need, now just calculate the fuel penalty and add it.

3- (5037/1000)x60=302.
302+5037= 5339
- Name: Levente
  Comment: Now I get it, but I used another method. Focus on that we need to have 7100 kg when departing from eidw. In order to achieve this, we need to depart from lfpg with the target fuel of 5226 (lfpg-eidw) and some extra (we need to find this). The key is that of this 5226 we won't consume the reserves, we'll have those at eidw.
Let's check our actual fuel in tanks after landing at eidw (basically the reserves of lfpg-eidw route): 157+992+914=2063, we already have this, but we need 7100, so we need 5037 kg more. But don't forget, that taxiing after landing at eidw requires 173 kg (this is very speculative, based on that we need 173 kg of taxi fuel when departing from eidw), we need to add this to extra (otherwise we wouldn't have 7100 when departing). 5037+173=5210 kg is the extra fuel.
Looking at the fuel plan we see that on the lfpg-eidw route there's a penalty if you carry extra fuel (+60 kg for every +1000kg). Calculate the penalty: extra/1000*60= 5210/1000*60=313 kg is our penalty. As last step for total extra, add extra fuel and penalty: 5210+313=5523 kg. How they get 5506, I don't know, but that's the closest value in the answers. If you find it difficult, try to draw 2 fuel tanks for the two different airports, and depict the required amounts at each locations.
- Name: Levente
  Comment: I think 5339 should be correct, in other questions we never account for taxi fuel at the destination airport
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Levente, remember that LFPG-EIDW-LFPG trip is made at this question. Therefore taxi fuel at EIDW should be taken into account as it is not the final destination.
- Name: Avigator
  Comment: How much fuel i have on me right now= 5226 kg (block)
How much fuel i need at destination to come back without refuelling= 7100 kg (block)
How much extra needed=7100 kg - 5226 kg= 1874 kg

But
How much i will burn during taxi and trip to destination= taxi(230 kg) + trip(2933 kg)= 3163 kg

If i fill my tank with 1874 kg + 3163 kg= 5037 kg + 302 kg (penalty 60kg/1000kg)= 5339 kg on top of what i have right now
i will left with 7100 kg of block fuel at destination to come back without refuelling.

Basically i need to fill my tanks with 5226 kg + 5339 kg= 10,565 kg to make sure i have 7100 kg of block fuel at destination.

In my opinion i only need 5339 kg minimum extra.

Any corrections will be appreciated?

- Name: RotorBoat
  Comment: @dlatr assuming the new syllabus, i believe if it states "with variation" in the q it'll mean to use the 3% for your leg to your optional refuelling destination.

if it states without variation, then you assume 5%

also if it states suitable en-route alternate or en-route alternate, you use 3%

Alternate is given here but in question we do not have anything that C is our alternate so alternate been calculated and given.

The reason why this procedure is named REDUCED contingency is because you DONT TAKE YOUR 5 percent of your TRIP fuel. BUT only from the Decision Point to your destination.

- Name: zeymahse
  Comment: @Soran04 Yes, as far as I've undestood, so far. If it's written on the chart, it's magnetic track and if you need true track, you can use CDMVT to add/subtract Var to get your true track, but, if you use your plotter on the chart, you'll directly read the true track and in this case you'll use the variation only if you need magnetic track.
Here, for example, since there isn't any written route that connects the two points that are mentioned, I draw a line myself to connect them. Using the plotter I got 82° TRUE track. Var is 2°W so -2° (because West is negative and East is positive for Var) and with CDMVT ( you subtract the values when going from right to left and you add them when going from left to right) I got 82° - (-2°) so 82° + 2° = 84° MAGNETIC Track
I did not seach for the distance sinnce there is only one 84° option.

  Comment: calculators headwind formula (cos) , doesn't give good results when there is heavy crosswind like 80-90 degrees from the side. that's what I realized now.

Flight computer gives the correct one.
- Name: liquid7
  Comment: easy solution to this without Flight Computer:
the only thing thats changed is a 5° decrease in OAT.
if you compare the planned TAS for A-B to B-C youll see that a 5 degree difference meant 2 kts slower TAS.
so just subtract 2 kts from the planned GS for B-C all youll be fine.

  Comment: TAS is 174 on the CRP5 when corrected for temperature. So thats only 1kt from the one given in the FPL.
Next look at the flight plan and see that TAS - GS gives a 18 kt HWC.
174-18 = 156 .. close enough to the 155 given.
There is not mucht point to use the wind side of the CRP5 to get the GS now.
- Name: KowalFly
  Comment: On CRP5:
1. Calculate the TAS for 155 CAS at FL100 with M25. The result is approximately 172 TAS.
2. Apply the wind (165/55) on the wind side. This gives a 19° right drift and a GS of 171 kt.
3. Balance the solution so that the true heading, after balancing, is 226°. (Rotate 19° so the rotation matches the indicated drift under the wind mark.)
4. Read the GS under the wind mark, which is approximately 154 kt.
- Name: Anezka
  Comment: Could I kindly ask you to review my calculation as I cannot find out where am I making a mistake? When I use the CRP-5 to get GS, I get a result close enough to the correct answer. But in Flight Planning I prefer to use trigonometry functions for majority of questions as I find it more accurate. This is the only Q which gives me a wrong answer with trigonometry, so I cannot get my head around it. Thank you!

W/V at FL100 = 165/55
T = -25°
CAS = 155 kt
TR (T°) = 245°
Using CRP-5 to convert CAS to TAS => TAS = 174 kt (its a bit closer to 174 than 173).
hwc = 55 x cos(80°) = 9.55 kt
gs = tas - hwc = 174 - 9.55 = 164.45 kt
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Anezka, thank you for your comment. The reason why you cannot reach the correct answer is that you have not included the effect of the crosswind on the ground speed in your calculations.
If the crosswind speed is not excessively high relative to your TAS, you get results very close to the correct answer. Otherwise, even if there is only a crosswind, your ground speed will be slightly lower than your TAS.
Simply, in the case of no wind, the thrust of the aircraft is parallel to the course as no WCA is required. So 100% of the thrust is directed to the forward direction. So TAS and GS become equal. However, in the case of a WCA to the right or left, there is a difference between the direction of the aircraft's thrust and the course. In this case, the aircraft cannot provide 100% thrust on the required course.
Therefore, when calculating the ground speed, it is also necessary to calculate the effect of the crosswind by multiplying TAS by the cosine of WCA. So;
Effective TAS = TAS x cosine of WCA = 173 kt x cos (18°) = 164.5 kt
Ground Speed = Effective TAS - Headwind component = 164.5 - 9.5 = 155 kt

2. calcualte de new GS with the new TAS .

GS =173-9.55 = 163kt

155 KT IS INCORRECT// CHANGE THE ANSWER PLeasE

  Comment: Guys dont even do this on the crp5. The only thing that changed from the original flight plan is the TAS from 175 to 173 . Wind is exaclty the same.So the original GS was 157 fibd the CLOSEST answer possible. THATS IT !!

  Comment: Pls check my last comment and try it out, something is wrong here
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Leonardo. There is nothing wrong with this question, please follow step by step what is mentioned in the explanation to get the solution. The use of a flight computer is a bit different since the input in the two questions you mentioned are different. Remember the following;
When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre.
When the Heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre.
Let's go back to this question. With the expected delay given in the question, only the temperature value changed from -20 degrees to -25 degrees. As a result of the change in temperature, TAS is affected and becomes 173 kt. Subject to exactly the same wind the TAS is subjected to a headwind component of about 18 kt, as in the first situation, and the new GS becomes 155 kt. In this way, this question can be solved by finding only the TAS value from the flight computer. Consequently, the marked answer to this question is correct. Thank you for your comment.
- Name: Leonardo
  Comment: I definitely get 163 with formula..

However if I use CRP-5 wind down method I get 155 but only after correcting for drift which is not the method I was taught to calculate GS as demonstrated in question 332284

I can only conclude the answer is wrong. I believe whoever wrote the question used the wrong TCourse. Instead of using 245 from B to C they used TCourse 95 from A to B which gives you 155kts ground speed using formula.

Thoughts?
- Name: Leonardo
  Comment: Btw if you actually do the calculations for the data given in the annex they are wrong, hw should be around 10 kts, they just want you to see that you can understand that if condition stay the same so there is no big change
- Name: Kangaxx
  Comment: This question's annex seems wrong.
Pre-flight planning indicates winds of 165°55kt (as given in the forecast and current plan) and GS of 157 is given. New-planning makes us use winds of 165°55kt (as given in the second forecast) which is the same. So ground speed should not change. The only exaplanation to have 155 as a correct answer is that the current plan given in the annex was wrong from the start.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Kangaxx. TAS depends on altitude and temperature values. In this question, even if the wind direction and velocity are the same in both flight time intervals at the relevant level, TAS will change due to the temperature difference and consequently GS will also change.
In the winds and temperature aloft forecast validity 0601 UTC to 0900 UTC table, the temperature shown in row B to C and column FL100 should be M20, not M25. We will update this as soon as possible. Thank you for your comment.

  Comment: Take planned HW so planned TAS 175 - Planned GS 157 = 18kt planned HWC
Correct TAS for temperature (-25*C) = 173kt (CRP5)
Apply planned HW to corrected TAS = New TAS 173kt - 18kt = 155kt GS
- Name: MarkoM
  Comment: CR3 after temperature correction TAS = 173 follow page 39. of the CR3 booklet accounting for EFFECTIVE TAS

1) TAS=173, TC 245, HWC= almost 10kt, XWC=almost 55kt
2) use outer scale to determine CRAB angle for XWC=55 it is equal to 19 deg.
3) use effective black scale from the middle ring and read effective speed from 19 deg. on outer scale which equals 164 kt TAS
4) finally account for the HWC=10kt to obtain final GS, 164 - 10 = 154 kt

  Comment: Hello, how it possible that dooing it with CR3, i get a headwind of 10kts? could you explain it (at least onece) cause i thin the people using CR3 hace the same right ( like the others) to know how to do it (we are paying the same (as others), and if you think the only approbed method to get the results is using CPR5, also you could advise it ( but as far as i know EASA allows CPR5, CR3 & EB, so , please could you clarify please?
Thanks in advance.
P.D, would be nice from you, because i spent (as others) long time asking for a clarification about the differences between computers, and never got an answer from you guys.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Ramiro there is not any EASA approved mechanical flight/nav computer. According to students' feedback, the most known and reliable mechanical computers seem to be CRP-5 and E6B.
ATPLQ cannot recommend you what to buy, because it would be an unfair trade practice. There are several mechanical computers in the market and you should better advise, firstly, your flight school and, secondly, fora, social media and any other appropriate source to get informed for the appropriate mechanical computer for your exams.
As mentioned in a past reponse to your comments, the team has reviewed the explanation many times and it is correct.
- Name: jimbee
  Comment: step by step

1. first of all, it must be clear which information from the table is required --> W/V 165/055 & temp. -25C
2. convert CAS to TAS, I use the CR-3 computer for this. Set PA opposite temp and read TAS from 155 CAS --> TAS = 174
3. Now we need the effective TAS. Formula: eTAS = TAS x cos (sin-1 (wind / TAS)) = 174 x cos (sin-1 (55/174)= 165.07
4. Now we have to find the HWC: cos(245-165) x 55 = 9.55
5. last but not least: eTAS - HWC= 165.07 - 9.55 = 155.52

my last subject, good luck to all of you guys
- Name: aviator786
  Comment: guys, I have been doing these questions for a while now and figured out that the best thing to do is 1) try out doing trig and if you get an answer listed then thats the answer. IF this brings about a value that is not one of the options or is in. between two options use your CRP5.
here you do not need to bother with converting CAS to TAS as they give TAS 175. you still get right answer using their TAS given.
- Name: GGeri
  Comment: Why is everyone calculating? The conditions are just the same in both departure times, the GS remains the same.
- Name: Christian
  Comment: The answer is supposed to be 163..
COS(245-165)x55 is 10(your headwind)
After getting a TAS of 174 from the CRP, you subtract the 10 kt headwind to get a ground speed of approximately 163.

Any recent feedback on this?
- Name: Veronika
  Comment: Just a hint. Look at original FP calculations. Wind is the SAME. So only temperature changed, changing TAS from 175 to 173. Respectively GS will also change by 2 knots and become 155 instead of 157.
I still made all possible mistakes with CRP5 before I got to that point..
