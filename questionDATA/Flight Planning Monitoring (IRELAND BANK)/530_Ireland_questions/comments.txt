Question Number: AT00001
- Name: Alsanafi
  Comment: I like to solve it Step by step :

1) Fuel difference = 360-241=119

2) ETO difference = 18:52-19:45=53min
Fuel/Time = 119/(53/60)=134.7 kg/h

3) ATO difference= 18:52-19:42=50min
Fuel Time= 119/(50/60)=142.8 kg/h

4) Fuel consumption difference = 142.8-134.7=8.1kg/h

  Comment: same amount of fuel, in shorter amount of time
-> fuel ratio increases

good luck ;)

  Comment: From a mathematics point of view, this is exactly like asking : you're at this position and it's 12:00pm, what's your speed?
I might need an initial time and position to tell you how fast I'm going...
- Name: BennyB
  Comment: IMO theres not enough info to categorically say the consumption is higher with only the one actual fuel check figure, theres some big assumption being made no? Question No 337587 is a perfect example of this, and actually has exactly the same figures as this annex, where the fuel consumption actually remains the same and the GS is higher than planned, so they burn less total fuel, but the consumption is the same. Also for this question, you can't really assume that they will have 15kg less again at the waypoint because the GS is clearly different to planned if you look at the ETO vs ATO. Surely this is an appealable question?

  Comment: Hello @TopGun81, thank you for your feedback. The question you are referring to is similar to question 337587 in our database. Please check this question and compare it with the one you encountered in the official exam.
- Name: AntonB
  Comment: The logic behind the "correct" answer to this question is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing in the question indicates that we fly at a higher speed or lower altitude than planned, so the only reason as to why we arrive at TORDU earlier than planned is that we have a stronger tailwind than expected. The wind is the only factor we don't control. Our TAS and altitude remain unchanged, thus our fuel flow is also unchanged but our GS is higher than planned, therefore our actual fuel consumption must be lower than planned!
- Name: Ianmchale
  Comment: 360-241=119 kg
Estimated takes 53 minutes therefore 119/53 x 60=134.7
Actual takes 50 minutes therefore 119 / 50 x 60=142.8
142.8-134.7=8.1kg

  Comment: @robinrooster what do you mean?
- Name: klappan
  Comment: One of the most difficult questions in the entire DB. You need to assume an identical fuel consumption of planned vs. actual (119 kg) between TOC and TORDU, but nothing in the question gives a clue about this. You simply need to know it to solve the Q, then it's easy.
- Name: robinrooster
  Comment: giVen fuel -> V = 5kg
not given -> 8kg
- Name: TB20Sam
  Comment: This question is ridiculous. It's basically expecting us (without telling us) to assume that the fuel consumption per unit ground distance is exactly the same as planned, despite the fact that we're travelling at a faster groundspeed than planned and our fuel burn on the flight so far has been less than planned. This is unrealistic and not how fuel planning and monitoring works in the real world.

In the real world you would do another fuel check at SOPET or TORDU and calculate the actual fuel consumption from that. Not guess it based on pie-in-the-sky imaginary assumptions.

What's the point of even asking a question like this; what are they hoping that we learn from it?
- Name: Manjitha
  Comment: Do planned fuel and actual fuel burn.

1. planned fuel burn 360 - 241 = 119 in 53 minutes , in 60 minutes --> 53/119 X 60 = 134.7
2.Actual fuel burn is 15 kgs less that is given at top of climb 375 compared to planned 360 (375-360 = 15 )

Therefore actual fuel left at TORDU 241 + 15 = 256 kgs and fuel burned in 50 minutes (19:42 - 18:42) is 119

Actual fuel consumption 119 / 50 X 60 = 142.8

Fuel left 142.8 - 134.7 = 8.1
- Name: Anezka
  Comment: These questions should be easy ones but for some reason I keep struggling to solve them correctly. So I am giving up:
3 Q about TORDU in the database.

TORDU at 19:42 -> 263 kg
TORDU with 1 figure in Fuel Check column -> 8kg/h higher
TORDU with 2 figures in Fuel Check column -> 5kg/h higher
- Name: SHOKS
  Comment: U consume same fuel but reach 3 minute earlier hence u have consumed an extra 3 min of fuel which amounts to approx 7.1 kg of fuel in 50 min. That is about an 8 kg per hour extra fuel consumption rate.
- Name: Fern14
  Comment: Agree with Erich that to compare actual and plan fuel, you need at least two actual fuel values to compare. Without that, you can try the smartest calculation, it is wrong no matter what. This question is terrible, on top of being inaccurate in its solution logic. Your questions bank is very good in general, but be careful what you try to teach to young pilots. I am doing those exams to convert FAAto EASA, and those type of questions with unrealistic explanations should be avoided. Other than that, great job.
- Name: P210N
  Comment: We start with 15 kg more fuel then planed in the race and have obviously a higher Groundspeed, less airtime and thus less consumption. No way the actual consumption can be 8,1 higher than the panned - one do not need a calculator to see this, as long as there no hint, that the poweer setting has changed in between and we are now burning more fuel.
- Name: NADER
  Comment: Over toc we have extera 15kg of fuel so IF we arrive at each point at exact ETO we should end up having +15kg of fuel.
But we arrive over Sopet and Tordu at earlier times , which means we are faster.
For simplicity forget the +15kg as it is confusing.
Between TOC and Tordu according to ETO(53min) and PLANING FUEL REMAINING (119kg) we should burn 134.7kg/hr.
BUT
According to ATO we are faster and are burning 119kg in 50min which is a fuel burn of 142.8kg/hr

142.8 - 134.7 =8.1 kg

Its a bit confusing but you can memorize it this way to pass the test !
- Name: SyedAta
  Comment: in Q No 337587 almost same condition and fuel was saved by 7 Kg, how the consumption could be more right in the next question without change of values ? please reply
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @SyedAta, thank you for your comment. In question 337587, fuel calculation was based on the planned fuel flow instead of the actual fuel flow as stated in the text of this question. That is;
Fuel flow = (Planned fuel remaining at ToC - Planned fuel remaining at TORDU) / Planned flight time from ToC to TORDU = [(360 kg - 241 kg) / 53] x 60 = 135 kg/hr.
In question 335104, the actual fuel flow was compared with the planned fuel flow and here the planned fuel flow is also the same as the question 337587.
As a result, fuel consumption varies depending on whether the fuel flow used in the fuel calculation is actual or planned.
- Name: jonathonjames
  Comment: Ive seen a few interesting comments here that it isnt solvable, I solved it but in a different manner to the explanation:

The expected fuel burn between TOC and TORDU is 119 in 53 minutes giving a fuel burn of 2.245kg/min.
The actual time between TOC and TORDU is 50 minutes, giving 112kg at the same rate of burn as above.

The difference between them is about 7kg, (plus / minus a few decimal points) however if we look at the fuel at TOC it is 15kg higher than expected, so add the 15 back on: we get 127kg. 127-119 = 8kg more than we expected to have.

I have no idea whether this is the correct method, but mathematically it makes sense and it did get me the correct answer.. .. ..

  Comment: If we somehow end up with more fuel than planned we are burning more fuel ?
- Name: Mrspoun
  Comment: This question is really nonsense, if the fuel flow is different we cannot simply assume that the difference btw planned and actual remains 15 kg?!
- Name: GhaithGarraoui
  Comment: Those 15 kg could be gained in a 10 minute, 15 minute, 20 minute climb, etc. How can we suppose the aircraft hasn't gain even more in the cruise between TOD and TORDU when we don't have the fuel check figure at TORDU?
- Name: chesl
  Comment: how is it possible to assume that we will have the same extra 15 kg at TORDU if our flight time and conditions (eg GS, wind cond, whatever) are different? it is vague as hell! god help us
- Name: Spaceman
  Comment: In this one it is 8kg/h as the do not give you the information about how much fuel you have used.

There is another similar one where it is 5kg/h and they give you the fuel information.

Helps if you are short on time. Good luck!
- Name: Anaaaaa
  Comment: so far ive seen 2 types of this question:
- there is a given value of fuel check at TORDU = 5kg/h higher than planned
- there is NO given value for fuel check at TORDU = 8kg/h higher than planned
- Name: rmocholi
  Comment: I had the question 337587 just before this one. It asks the actual fuel remaining whith the same exact annex. I tried to extract it with the method of this question and it were wrong, now i use the method of that question on this one and it's wrong. There the correct answer for the same thing (Fuel remaining at TORDU) is 263kg and here is 256. If there is no consistency between the methods i would use in every case i don't know what tf im studying, it feels more like a lottery than an evaluation of knowledge.

- Name: cskpe
  Comment: Anac today, diff values, and there was a fuel check on 3rd line.

the 375 fuel check, minus the value on the 3rd check, would give the same amout of used fuel as per the planned.
on the flying there was just 15L more of fuel on the tanks. both would be 119 less than the first line

I've contested it arguing that it's not specified if the 'planned fuel consumption' they mention is just for the fisrt 3 legs, or for the whole flight.

for the first 3 legs, no change, for the whole flight it would've raised..
- Name: Nikko
  Comment: So, how do you calculate actual fuel consumption without any actual fuel figures for the leg in question? Maybe this is just another case of a really badly worded question - shouldnt the question be asking what the replanned fuel consumption is rather than actual consumption? With the only ACTUAL figure being the fuel check after the climb, there is absolutely no information about actual cruise consumption, which is what you would need in order to answer this question. Am I missing something?

  Comment: I had this question at Austro NL today BUT there was now a value written down for the fuel at TORDU: 258 kg. And that made the correct answer 5 kg/h more.
- Name: Czajnik
  Comment: @Michael you are just guessing that you burned 119kg of fuel in 50 minutes. There is no clue in the question/annex to confirm this.
- Name: Michael
  Comment: Got it first try, here is how: Planned FF = 119 kg / 53 min = 135 kg/hr.
Actual FF = 119 kg/50 min = 142.8 kg/hr - 135 kg/hr = 8 kg/hr higher.
- Name: Maverickopoulos
  Comment: This should not even be solvable with the provided data. Why are we here assuming random numbers. (Yes, assuming you will still burn 119 kg without any reason/evidence is random)
- Name: PedroL FINISHEDATPL
  Comment: 119 * 60 / 53 = 134.7
119 * 60 / 50 = 142.8

142.8 - 134.7 = 8.1kg/h higher
= 167 GS needed to reach 3 minutes earlier at TORDU, the aircraft consumed more fuel, which, in fact, TAS remains constant as it doesn't vary with change in wind, but GS does. Might some info in the table be wrong? Assuming you can't have an increase in fuel flow without changing GS (with TAS constant)

Cheers
- Name: Jifi68
  Comment: I think that there is a problem. So according to the plan we should have taken 53 min and consume 119kg of fuel to fly the leg.
During the actual flight, we only took 50 min to fly the leg, but no fuel check has been done at TORDU, so how can we assume that we also consume 119kg of fuel ?? Maybe we consume more fuel, or may be less fuel. Or maybe we just flew faster because of tailwind with the same fuel consumption ?

What I want to say is, without a real fuel check, we don't know how many fuel we still have in the tank at TORDU, so we can't calculate a consumption.
Are you sure that the annex is complete ?
- Name: Putinisaknob
  Comment: This awful question has me confused on two points. One, how are we able to assume that whilst we used less fuel than intended on the first leg, the rest of the legs will go to plan. And secondly, if it has actually used less fuel on the first leg, how does the answer come out that we end up using more fuel than intended?
- Name: Sam
  Comment: Had this on 24/4/23 UK CAA, there was an additional '258kg' stated in the AFOB for TORDU which meant the calculation came out to roughly +5kg/h higher than planned
- Name: Thomas
  Comment: Seen in Sweden 22/04/23.

Different numbers. The correct answer was 5kg higher.
- Name: Usamakhan
  Comment: How can you just -magically- assume that the fuel consumed is always 15 kg less. One way only, Id assume that throughout the journey it has used 15 kg less, and somehow the consumption becomes higher.
Lets just disregard the entire journey, right?.

One thing we all can agree upon for sure, the CAA exam creators are either drunk or high 24/7.

- Name: NeilAquilina
  Comment: In the first 8 minutes you burnt 15 kg LESS than expected and somehow we have a higher fuel consumption per hour.
- Name: Livia
  Comment: @atplq got this in my exam Rome, Italy 22.02.2023
In the annex the fuel check at Tordu was already given and it was 258kg, so the fuel flow was 140kg/hr and the difference between the planned consumption(135kg/hr) was 5kg/hr higher . I assume that was the correct answer.
- Name: Hannes
  Comment: You can't assume that the fuel consumed from TOC to TORDU stays the same if the ATO's change. Of course the fuel consumption per hour will be higher if you consume the fuel in less time. The question makes no sense.
- Name: Ferdiwagner
  Comment: What the explanation does it is assumes same fuel consumed per NGM as planned, but we have no reason to believe that to be true, since it obviously was not up to our only fuel check.
What i would do here is assume the leg to TOC is our only leg so far, and we have used 15kg less fuel than planned up to this point.
It has taken us 8 minutes to get here, so 15kg less than planned per 8 minutes, which is 112.5kg/h less than planned.
The answer is obviously extremely high, but without a second fuel check i have no idea how else one would calculate it.
Let's just hope we have a second fuel check on exam, as some people have commented.
- Name: Radoslaw
  Comment: where is logic again ? Why you point out that we have used 15 kg less at the beginning if you dont use in calculations later? Its non essential information then and misleading. You simply took same fuel burn and calculated for 50 and 53 minutes of trip. Why you confuse us ?
- Name: Marcelo
  Comment: So we just need to *assume* that the amount of fuel consumed in that distance (119 Kg) will be the same, despite having consumed 15 Kg less than expected until TOC. Very poor question indeed.
- Name: mariamaria
  Comment: 360-241=119 kg
ETO: 53min => 119:53x60=134.7
ATO: 50min => 119:50x60=142.8

142.8-134.7=8.1kg
- Name: UNCLEPIP
  Comment: Yesterday I had this question in UK CAA with the exact same wording but they gave the actual fuel remaining at tordu which I remember roughly about 215 remaining. That figure most likely wont be right but its a guess.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi guys, the current correct option has been confirmed by students. The explanation translates how we assume EASA solved this exercise. Unfortunately, there is no link between us and the authority, so there is no way we can refute this question. All we can suggest is that you leave a comment explaining why you do not agree with it.
In the meantime, we would highly appreciate any further feedback.
- Name: Camelia
  Comment: @ATPL Q : the question asks about the fuel consumption, and in the answers we have fuel flows. This is unexpected. You then consider, in the calculation, that the fuel consumption remains the same from TOC to TORDU, as you consider that we still have 15kg extra when reaching TORDU. Nowhere it is stated that we have the same consumption, this is a huge assumption. And by using the same fuel consumption, you actually answer the question. Could you please check the wording? And whether the actual fuel check wasnt provided, because this is a very unclear question making us make a big assumption based on no information provided !
- Name: Michael
  Comment: @ATPLQ I cant follow your calculation. The first fuel check indicates that we burned 15 less than planned. So how comes that we burn more fuel than planned in the end?
- Name: Erich
  Comment: @ATPLQ I understand how you worked this out.. but really, one fuel check at ToC is really not how you work out average fuel flow. You need at least one more fuel check after that at cruise conditions to get any real idea of what's going on
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS

  Comment: Distance to PET= D x H/ O+H, you can remember the distance as: Distance to PET the dog( DHOH) like in an Dutch accent
Distance to pet is required for the Time to PET calculation.
Time to PET= Distance to pet/ O(GS out)

Distwnce to PSR= Endurance x O x H/ O+H ( you can remember it like someone calling your attention ( EOH) then O+H
Distance to PSR is required for the Time to Psr calculation
psr= e+h/o+h ( the same as the distance to pet, but just swap the d(distance) for e(endurance)

  Comment: I think u got it exactly opposite of what it is

Flight plan endurance is without reserves because that is when ur tanks run dry and SAR is launched

  Comment: How to remember: PSR = POINT OF SAFE RETURN. It is not safe if we return with no reserves intact, so pick reserves intact option. Now, PSR is not POINT OF EQUAL TIME so do not pick the option that has something to do with EQUAL TIME. rest to remember is, return back to dest, alt or dep.
- Name: Marlboro
  Comment: @bozhidar, .wind is a factor. If you have equal flight time in the air, but a strong headwind back to departure, you may fly for 1hr, but cover a small distance. Based on GS out, home, we establish a point where sufficient fuel is there to either return or proceed to destination.
- Name: George
  Comment: It wouldn't be a safe return if you had no fuel upon arrival. Also not in the same time, that is associated with the Point of Equal Time. Use process of elimination.

  Comment: IAA today but heavily reworded.
Something similar to what Mayahuel298 described below. In my case I had a route from one coordinates to another (flying westwards but not enough info provided to find out an actual track) and the wind changed from something like 295/60 to 225/60 (not sure about exact values).

I had 3 Qs in my exam about FMC. Unfortunately I cant find them in the bank.
Exam was around 50% Irish bank, only few questions that I havent seen before, the rest was ok, just different numbers but same principles. Its passable but I recommend to do full bank, not only the Irish one.
- Name: Daffy
  Comment: At the same CI speed increases, but not necessarily to maintain ETAs. Its about performance and range.
- Name: FlyingLegend
  Comment: This would increase our cost index, that we set before the flight, it just doesn's make any sense. The FMS would suggest a different optimum flight level and calculate a different ETA

Please see our previous comment for detailed information on wind input into the FMS. Thank you for your comment.
- Name: Pipinho
  Comment: None of the options here are 100 correct
Id appeal. And if it appears on the exam just think about performance when we are suppose to increase speed for a headwind

  Comment: Greetings everyone! I greatly appreciate all of your comments and feedback. As a Boeing 737 pilot myself, I must admit that I have some reservations about the currently accepted correct option. However, it has been reported by students that this answer was deemed correct in their exams. In such cases, I would encourage you to challenge this question if you encounter it in your own examinations.
Now, let's discuss the behavior of the Flight Management System (FMS) when there is a variance between the actual wind and the wind entered into the FMS:
If the FMS detects a difference in wind, it will calculate a new optimal speed based on the updated wind data and the entered cost index. However, this adjustment is applicable only when the VNAV mode is set to ECON. If a fixed speed is selected, the FMS will continue flying at that speed regardless of the wind conditions. In such cases, the FMS will continuously recalculate the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) based on the current time, position, actual wind for the current leg, and inserted winds for other legs.
Most FMS systems provide a feature that allows pilots to reach a specific waypoint at a predetermined ETA. When this mode is activated, the FMS will continuously recalculate and adjust the speed to achieve the desired ETA at the specified waypoint. It's worth noting that this mode is not a standard operating mode.
Thank you once again for your valuable contributions!

  Comment: I fly the 737-800, I can tell you the "correct" answer is wrong. It does not work like this. FMC will maintain the ECON cruise speed regardless of wind errors.
- Name: Putinisaknob
  Comment: Having just spoken with a thirty year and 22,000 hour training captain, this is absolute cobblers. Whilst you can set an ETA it is almost never used. Can you imagine using this going across the pond? ATC would do their fruit. Another example of being taught stuff incorrectly...

  Comment: @ATPLQ, I totally agree with Hassib on the idea, that FMS will just give you new estimates. The function of maintaining the preset point crossing time is an option and needs to be programmed by pilots additionally, sometimes it even exceeds the AC capability and FMS will state that. So in general, it just shows you what changes are there based on wind. Though, thats digging too deep into FMS functions and apparently Its not what EASA wants. So lets just assume, that FMS does some magic and always keeps the AC arriving on time. Haha. Other answers are more ridiculous though.
- Name: SMU
  Comment: I might not agree with the correct answer but the other options are way more incorrect
- Name: Hassib
  Comment: @ATPLQ Regarding this specific question, your explanation is incorrect, FMS calculations are based on crew input, lets say actual wind at FL350 is 150/80 and mistakenly it is entered by crew as 050/80, FMS will do all its calculation based on 050/80 and provides ETA and fuel Calculation based on wrong inserted wind. RTA is a completely different function in FMS and has nothing to do with what the question asks. If actual wind differs with inserted wind in the FMS, ETA will be shown either early or late based on what wind direction and velocity inserted in contradiction with actual wind. Thank you!
- Name: James
  Comment: The FMS will only increase your speed to attain a RTA (required time of arrival). This has to be inserted into the FMS by the crew. If this is not done all that happens is that your actual time of arrival at waypoints will be later than your estimated time of arrival at said waypoints.

Question Number: AT00005
- Name: TRUMP88
  Comment: Arriving at DESTINATION = FINAL reserve + ALTERNATE fuel
Arriving at ALTERNATE = FINAL reserve ONLY
- Name: Thordur
  Comment: Also fell for it, contigency is not added as the question is asking, what MINIMUM fuel is to be expected to have remained onboard after landing under NORMAL circumstances - contigency fuel is and shall be used under normal circumstances, thus the MINIMUM fuel to be expected is ALTN and final reserve fuel.
- Name: Nikko
  Comment: Contingency not included as a minimum because it exists as a buffer for unforeseen, minor changes en route. It exists so that when you have to detour, change altitude or speed because of unexpected ATC or weather issues you have a buffer. If it was a minimum requirement at destination then that would mean you could not use it en route - which contradicts its purpose.
- Name: Rad07
  Comment: Seen IAA, but it was reworded, Final reserve fuel was stated as (RSF) but concept the exact same.
- Name: Vafut
  Comment: Not true. Based on weather forecast if it is sure that weather will improve at Dest., the PIC can decide not to go to alternate and use the ALTN in hold over Dest..
- Name: Serkan
  Comment: @jonathan @SariCizmeli contingency is carried for additional fuel consumption enroute due to wind and etc so you can use that fuel and assume that it is used in questions like this
- Name: jonathanlaukner
  Comment: In M&B i just had a question asking about the fuel and it states: "The Landing Mass at Dest. is DEFINED with the ZFM + Cont. + Alternate + Final Reserve Fuel"

So if the Mass is defined that way, why not add the cont?
- Name: CookieMonsta
  Comment: pretty weird how it emphasizes NORMAL which in that case i would also add contingency fuel but then says minimum so alternate + final would be correct
- Name: HarryPotter
  Comment: Tricky Question and there's a few in the bank like this. The EASA examiner never considers
the contingency fuel as an "EXPECTED MINIMUM FUEL". I know this is technically incorrect, we don't plan to use the contingency fuel but the examiner assumes the pilots "expect" or "plan" to use it.

So the answer will either be: Final Reserve + Alternate Fuel = Destination
OR Final Reserve = Alternate

  Comment: Guys I believe I got it Normal conditions is the usual, so don't get misled by it.

-If it says MINIMUM REQUIRED - then exclude the contingency from the expected LM as it is not a requirement,

- Name: Radoslaw
  Comment: The whole stupid story is to mislead you
- Name: Sydney
  Comment: As everyone else is saying - the question stresses "normal conditions" and "expected" fuel (not required). Expected would include contingency. Required would only be Alternate & Final Reserve (at destination). Very badly written.
- Name: 737spacecadet

  Comment: @Uffhansa There are 2 very similar questions: 333260 (this question) and 336167. The 2 questions are almost identical however, in one of them the pilot is being radar vectored, whilst in the other the pilot is not being radar vectored.
@Noworries The 2 questions do not contradict, they are referring to 2 different scenarios. The issue is that in question 333260 it is not made clear that the pilot is not being radar vectored.

  Comment: Maybe it is 6,500ft because the grid altitude at EDNP is the same grid altitude of the grid above which is 5,400 ft.
I think it could be, since every grid has a grid altitude in red, except for this one, and maybe this means that it has the same grid altitude than the upper grid.

- Name: Bonus
  Comment: Why we don't add 15% in this case ? Thx for info.
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: guys the question is very poorly written but what it is saying is:
the a/c minimum fuel at the alternate must be at leas the FRF. so 45mins of holding FF gives us a FRF=45liters.
this means that at destination our minimum fuel must be FRF+alternate fuel= 45+38= 83liters.

so when the aircraft arrives at destination he still has its "minimum fuel at destination which is 83liters.

  Comment: Please let me know if my understanding is wrong?


*Reserve for Piston= 45Min - Question says that fuel flow is 80L/h -> how much it will be in 45Min? 45Min x 80L/h /60= 60L Arriving at destination 60L + 22L of Go Around (when you arrive at your destination you will have it on board) = 82L at Destination


* To fly to Alternate you will use 38L -> 60L - 38L= 44L at Alternate

  Comment: 45 minutes holding

CAT.OP.MPA.181 (c) (5)

final reserve fuel/energy that shall be the amount of fuel/energy that is calculated at
holding speed at 1 500ft (450 m) above the aerodrome elevation in standard conditions
according to the aeroplane estimated mass on arrival at the destination alternate
aerodrome, or destination aerodrome when no destination alternate aerodrome is
required, and shall not be less than:
(i) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, the fuel/energy to fly for 45 minutes; or
(ii) for turbine-engined aeroplanes, the fuel/energy to fly for 30 minutes

Honestly this should have been in the explanation instead of saying it is not known..
- Name: Phoebe
  Comment: Can someone confirm whether this is holding or cruise speed? Personally would have said it was 45 mins at CRUISE speed (as many others have too). If it is at holding speed, would you say this was appealable?

Thanks!!
- Name: Alexandros
  Comment: is it still confirmed 83/45 for Austro? As according to the theory, it should be 98/60 as you are supposed to use cruise consumption for a piston engine and NOT holding.
Would love a quick response!
- Name: Roman
  Comment: I suppose that find final reserve fuel for 45 min (45L) is enough to pass it and proceed ahead.
- Name: Antoniorosado94
  Comment: So, this question is actually incorrect, because its fuel to flow for 45 min, not at holding speed. Then, what should we do? Memorize this answer? Appeal in the exam if we get it wrong? Actually, I dont have any idea on how to face these exams where the answers are wrong and sometimes you have to give the right answer and sometimes the wrong us the right one. I wanna die

  Comment: Thank you, @Edoardo, for bringing the error to our attention! We apologize for the mistake in the holding fuel consumption that was initially provided. Nonetheless, we are pleased to inform you that the final result was accurate, and we have since corrected the error.

  Comment: Final reserve

Piston = 45min at normal operating (cruise) speed

Jet = 30min at holding speed 1500ft above (alternate) aerodrome level
- Name: Alex
  Comment: In the question hold speed fuel flow is given as 60l/h and cuise speed fuel flow as 80l/h. In the explaination it says calulate it as 45/60 x holding speed fuel flow = 45/60 x 80, but 80 is cruise flow, so it says use hold fuel flow but then youve used cruise fuel flow. Confused.
- Name: PietroEletto
  Comment: @atpl question number 333233 you give us the opposite answer (98 USG ; 60 USG ). Match the questions please and correct them!!
Anyway, I dont know the feedback from EASA, but PadPilot says specifically for reciprocating engine we should use 45 min at cruise level. So damn absurd..
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi everyone, thank you for all your comments!
This question has been reviewed and updated. The regulation is quite ambiguous, it says that for reciprocating engines, the final reserve equals the fuel required to fly for 45 minutes and it doesn't specify if it's at holding or cruising speed.
If anyone comes across this question, please let us know! :)

- Name: Lorenz
  Comment: @ATPLQ The Padpilot book stated 30 min at holding speed 1500ft for jet and ''FUEL TO FLY'' without mentioning HOLDING speed for 45 minutes for the reciprocating engine (CAT.OP.MPA.150).
Would you mind posting the official document?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Lorenz, "fuel to fly" is exactly what is written. It does not have to be cruising. Therefore holding conditions can be used.

  Comment: Fuel Burnt: 1098 — 780 = 318 lb
Distance covered burning the fuel above: 183 NM
Distance remaining to go to B: 460 — 183 = 277 NM

If we burnt:
183 NM = 318 lb
277 NM = ? lb

277 x 318 / 183 = 481 lb

Remaining fuel at airport B: 780 — 481 = 299 lb

- Name: MarkW
  Comment: Fuel burnt so far after 183 NM: 1098 - 780 = 318 lbs
We will burn in total: 460 NM / 183 NM = 799 lbs
We had 1098 lbs, so we end with 1098 lbs - 799 lbs = 299 lbs (plus reserves)
- Name: Qasimmohmammed
  Comment: 318lb burned in 183NM
SO 318/183 =1.73lb/NM
TOTAL distance is 460NM
Fuel consumption is 460NM multiple by 1.73lb/NM=799
Feul remaining is 1098-799=299
- Name: Tim07
  Comment: "assuming conditions remain the same" refer to the conditions we have now, as they're listed before. But instead of writing "and given" they should mark it as planned or something. Pretty confusing wording.

- Name: josselintixier
  Comment: from A, you covered 183 Nm and burnt 318lbs
460 (total distance) /183 = 2.51
2.51 x 318 = 799.34 (fuel burnt for 460Nm)
1098 (trip fuel) - 799 = 299l
- Name: RajHamsaXAir
  Comment: I think that fuel flow given in the question should say ''PLANNED average fuel flow'', or ''planned fuel flow'', so as to avoid confusion by the students.
- Name: Paul82
  Comment: The wording is terrible. The question part, ie the sentence with colon at the end, instructs you to use the following data. There is no arguing that that's what it says. Then you go ahead and use the following data and they go "aha! you used the wrong data". This is not even funny anymore.
- Name: Monica
  Comment: Friends, don't overcomplicate it. Consider that at 183 NM, they consumed 318 lbs, so at 460 NM they will consume 799 pounds. This leaves them with a remaining fuel of 299 lbs. Enjoy the 3 free points
- Name: SHIYU

- Name: Razinzaki
  Comment: So how do I specifically know when to use the fuel flow given when if it says "planned fuel flow" I should ignore but with just "fuel flow" it would presumably mean that that is the correct fuel flow for the remainder of the given sector..
- Name: Cano2020
  Comment: I calculate it like:
total trip- remaining fuel

1098 lb - 780 lb = 318 lb

318 lb / 183 NM = 1,73 lb / Nm

1,737 Nm x 277 Nm = 481 lb

Remaining fuel = 799 lb - 481 lb = 299

- Name: shuauli
  Comment: 1098-780=318Ib

- Name: Alex
  Comment: This can not be correct! Trip fuel is not the total take off fuel. You can not just subtract the remaining from trip fuel. This is insane! If 1098 would be the take off fuel, then yes. But this is completely wrong in my opinion.

- Name: Michal
  Comment: so basically statement "conditions remain the same AND GIVEN:" is a lie? hahah I have no words about how ridiculous this quesiton is. I honestly can do all of these calculation but I still chose the wrong answer casue I thought that the actual conditions are given so there's no need to calculate them again. It's also disgusting that this questions appeared so many times in official exams.
- Name: LAWRENCE
  Comment: Just a note to those who are sitting the UK CAA version of this Flight Planning exam. This sort of question is a trap, the comments whihc state you should appeal this may not have taken the actual exam and realised there are some issues with that approach. First of all you do not know if you are wrong at the point where you can comment on the question. You don't get the result until the end of the sitting which may be days later and even then if you have more than one question incorrect from the same learning objective you don't know exactly which one is incorrect.
Those who have sat this exam on the CAA system will know that the change to the title of the paper for 2020 syllabus means the title now occupies two lines at the top of the screen covering the comments button. If you need to comment you need to hand a written note to the examiner. How would you know at the point of sitting the exam that this or any question is ambiguous? Lastly, if you are on UK CAA and request a paper to be reviewed (Appeal) there is a significant fee.
The Moral of the story is simple, without resources like ATPLQ we would simply carry on failing these exams and have no idea why.

  Comment: Make it easy !
We burn (1098-780) 318lb for a distance of 183 NM
So for a distance of 460 NM = (318/183) x 460 = 799lb burnt
Then 1098 - 799 = 299lb
Hope it helps ;)

  Comment: Seen UK CAA but they say planned fuel flow
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi guys, thank you for your comments!

This question is without doubt unfortunate. Here are my conclusions:
It seems that there is a similar question to this in our database which uses the fuel flow provided instead of calculating the fuel flow in the first leg. I believe that the difference which leads to different approaches is the wording. In this question, we can see that the examiner states "assuming conditions remain the same" => this leads us to calculate the actual fuel flow for the first leg, disregarding the provided fuel flow for the remaining calculations.
The other question states "assuming the data below" => we are prompted to use the fuel flow provided and not calculate the fuel flow used for the first leg.

I would like to add that we have received several feedback from students confirming the current correct options for both questions. We can only advise you to report this questions in your official examinations, as different people can interpret them differently as the differences are minimal and the solution changes significantly.
- Name: JayDEE
  Comment: I was also lost with this question. But in the end I managed to simplify it.
1) Actual fuel burn: 1.73 lb/ NM
2) 277 NM x 1.73 = 481
3) 780 - 481 = 299

Because:
I consumed 318 lb of fuel to travel 183 NM (1.73lb/N)
So if I want to travel 277 NM I will consume 277 x 1.73 = 481 lbs
If I had 780 left; upon arrival I have 780- 481 = 299 lbs.

  Comment: Hey! @lodovico @Zoltan Felix I had today this question in my exam, and the correct answers is correct here. The fuel flow that they are giving you is the planned, you have to calculate the actual fuel flow with the distanca, the ground speed (Which in both cases is the same), then you calculate the time and with that you calculate the actual fuel flow, which is the one that you will need in the end of the exercise

convert heading to track: 1) xc: 46 x cos (90 -330) = 39.8 2) drift: XC x 60 : TAS => 39.8 X 60 : 300 = 8 drift Right
3) track = heading + drift= 90 + 8 =98°
4) find GS: 46 x cos (98-330) = -28.3 (tailwind) --> Gs: 300 of tas + 28.3 of tw = 328.3 !!
if u completely ignore the fact that u have a heading instead of a track, and use the heading ( which is wrong ) the result is 323!
46 x cos (90-330) = 23 tailwind, gs= 323!!
how should i choose between 320, 325 and 330 idk

- Name: Joris31
  Comment: tail wind component: cos(60) * 46 = 23 kts
cross wind component: sin(60) * 45 = 39.8 kts
so ground speed components are [300+23, 39.8] kts, which norm is 325 kts
- Name: danwen
  Comment: What some here are calculating with cosine to get a tailwind component is not fully true. even an exact crosswind increases the groundspeed because that drift adds to it slightly
- Name: Lince01
  Comment: @MondegoTwoTwoTwo no need to correct for drift because they`re not giving you any track
- Name: Domino093
  Comment: Even marking the correct WV with 46 kts is super tricky, and then, they give you options to so close together. This question was probably made by some jaleous guy, who wasnt good enough to became a pilot, so he ended up creating questions for pilot exam, with pure intetion to fail all of us.

  Comment: when given a course correct CRP for heading and GS
when given heading, no need to correct CRP just read the GS = 325 kt
- Name: VASILEIOS
  Comment: He is not apply the heading change to counteract for the wind. Thats why in crp5 we find 320kt and he finds 325. The thing is that in some questions it applies correction and in some others dont.. Usually when it says Course you have to apply the heading correction for the wind, but when it says heading you dont have to.

  Comment: I got 320kt on my Crp-5 thought maybe im wrong so i tried again and made sure im accurate.
Doubted my crappy Crp-5 as its been through Gnav already (you can imagine the rage).
So I paid for a Crp-5 app right now for 3 euros, and did it as accurate as physically possible.
i still got exactly 320kt.
so my question is, what in the genuine fuvk am i supposed to do? sometimes its using the flight computer, and sometimes were expected to use the formula.
on top of all that the formula doesnt even give you 325kt.
So my question to Easa is, what the genuine fvck are you expecting from us to learn exactly, cuz this is genuinely disappointing for an authority with a 300M euro ANNUAL budget is not able to produce questions that actually make sense.
What a shame.

- Name: SyedAta
  Comment: remember acft is maintaining Hdg not track. so the GS will be 325 kts and not 320.
If it was forcefully maintaining track, then the tail wind component will reduce further and the answer would have been 320 kts. its always better to use manual computer

- Name: Sabrur
  Comment: Okay i'll let y'all know my trade of knowledge since my days back in Gnav and everything.

Scenerio 1: With FPL subject, if the question strictly asks you to find GS or TAS or WCA or drift by giving the 4 other information, basically questions like this, --> ALWAYS use a flight computer and the answer you get in it will be the correct answer provided here.

Scenerio 2: With questions where you have a lot of calculation, specially fuel calculation, they give you TAS and W/V component, and you need to find time, or ff or anything else, use
Wind component = Cos (wind direction - track) x Wind speed (since this method is faster, you use the result to determine your GS.
And you will get correct answers and thus you save time)

I know it's a lot to read but those of you who understands what I'm saying, try it, and you will NEVER get these questions wrong and will save time with the bigger calculation questions.

  Comment: @Phoebe, in this case we mark the wind DOWN because we have HDG given. If we had TRK given, we would mark the wind UP.

quick summary for whoever isn't sure about it:
1) HDG given , TAS - Wind speed, mark it DOWN
2) TRK given, TAS + Wind speed, mark it UP
- Name: Phoebe
  Comment: why do you mark wind down on this one??
- Name: Nathan
  Comment: Given Heading ..NOT track. Therefore don't apply wind down technique - literally line up heading on CRP5 and read off Ground speed.
- Name: Jan737
  Comment: In these questions you have to count with true TRACK, not heading. If true heading is 090 (with wind correction), true TRACK will be around 097 due to wind. Now count it again (or use E6B) and you will get slightly above 325.

Hope it helps, good luck :)
- Name: Christian
  Comment: Put this in your calculator:
COS(330-090)X 46 =-23(Negative means tailwind here because we're using the COS function).
Add 23 to your TAS to get your groundspeed, and round up.

  Comment: Hi @hilmi, it depends on whether your given a track/course or heading. For a heading, you should mark wind speed downwards and for a track, wind speed is marked upwards.
There are other ways of solving this exercises on your flight computer though. The method shown here is one of them.

I hope this helps! 🙂

  Comment: CRP-5:
1- Align TAS(300 kts) with the middle hole;

4- Align the TH given(090º) with the outer scale TH;

Starting at Alpha we have 5690 and after 1 hour of travel reaching Gama we have 4850.

Meaning we wasted 840kg per hour.

- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: the annex says that every 1000kg added, the trip fuel increases by 236kg. which means that every 1000kg added i burn 236kg more.
so if i add 1500kg, i will burn 354kg more of trip fuel. so trip fuel increases by 354kg.
so we have two possible answers. the first one is that if i want to have 1500kg extra usable, other than trip, i will need to add 1500kg+354kg to compensate fro fuel penalty.
the other one is that, if i dont compensate, of the 1500kg i add, 354kg will be lost as trip fuel burnt.
so here our actual extra fuel usable for holding will be 1500kg-354kg=1146kg.
with a FF=4500kg/h i get an extra time of 1146/4500=15mins

  Comment: 1500 Kg include the penalty from additional fuel. So, 1500/1.236 = 1214Kg as real extra fuel. Thus 1214/4500 = 0.2697h ~=16 min. Closest answer 15 min.

- Name: Piotr
  Comment: This can actually be done without calculation, just by logic. If FF=4500 kg/h and they load 1500kg that's 20 min flight time. Except you have to consider operational impact of heavier plane -> more fuel burn. There's only one answer with lower hold time than 20min
- Name: Javier
  Comment: Because you are adding more FUEL so your plane will be heavier and you have a fuel penalty due to that.
- Name: Aris
  Comment: stated positive but why suddenly minus? the impact operational is positive 354 for trip fuel, but why you minus the extra fuel?
- Name: Michal
  Comment: so what these others increases or decreases mean? like this minus 232 or plus 448? Why weare supposed to look at the plus 236kg in the operational impacts section?
- Name: Kadham
  Comment: Detailed explanation:

Penalty meant when you increase your fuel on board you are increasing the weight of the plane as well, so some of that extra fuel going tobe loss because of wieght increasment.

Here in this question for 1000 kg of weight increase you are going to burn 236 kg and this is the penalty

To calculate the penalty this is the formula to use : extra fuel/1000 x fuel panelty

So 1500/1000 x 236 = 345 and this is going to be a useless amount of fuel . Means going to be burn because of increasment of plane weight

So now to calculate the endurance of useful fuel from the 1500 we have to subtract the panelty
1500- 236=1146 and this is the useful fuel

To calculate the endurance of it devide it by the fuel flow

1146 / 4500= 15 mints

- Name: WAYNE
  Comment: Hmmmmmm. One has to consider the extra burn due to the 1500kg extra fuel carried. You can't just carry extra fuel weight without a penalty??In the operational impacts column it is 236kg extra burn per 1000kg= 348kg. >> 1500kg-348kg= 1152kg left. This will only give you 15min of holding at destination..

  Comment: Hello @matant01, thank you for your feedback. There is a similar question to the one you mentioned in our database, question number 337947.
- Name: kotasz
  Comment: Guys. I have 4 different navigation computers. CRP 5: 7 degrees left, GS=158. ASA E6-B: 7 degrees left, GS=158. AVIAT 617: 7 degrees left, GS=158. COMPUTADOR DE VOO from Brazil, EA-2: 7 degrees left, GS=158. I really dont get how you can get any other value on any of the existing flight computers. This type of question, with HDG provided, is the most straight-forward one. You put the wind point under the circle, then you set the heading and TAS and you are done. You can only encounter difficulties when the track is given instead of HDG. In this case, do not use the traditional wind down method with its iterative process. Rather, mark the wind point ABOVE the middle circle and set track under the heading. Then you set TAS under the wind point. And you always get a very accurate result.

  Comment: Using trigonometry, the drift is 6,14 DEG Left. because CWC = 19,28kts (lets say 19kts)
HWC is 23 kts. (precisly 22,98 kts).
so the only correct GS= 157 kts. but not a single option of that?
Even on back side of E6B on the bottom, if you look 40 deg in horizontal row and 30 kts in vertical row for windspeed it says 23 KTS for HWC and 19 kts for CWC..sad :(

The correct option is: 6 DEG drift to LEFT and GS=157 kts.

  Comment: You have to calculate your real drive using XWC and thereafter XWC x 60 / TAS now you apply the drift on your heading -> 20-6 = 14. Now you can use your Aviation Calculator. Don't get tricked when they give you a Heading!!

  Comment: ok ok ok! I got something here!

Personally i always use the method written on my E6B. Using this method with HDG i got WCA=6R, Drift 6L, which means a track (track made good) of 014. Doing it again with Track 014, it got me the answer that has as correct, GS=158 kts and WCA=7R exactly, which means Drift=7L.

For me it works and im going to keep it as a tip, hope it helps!

Generally appealing on that kind of questions,is a good strategy cause in any way, answers are so close and appealing them makes me them dissappear from the exam generators of the competent authorities.

  Comment: All your crp5 drift calculations using the dot up method? isn't this method only accepted up to ppl level since the drifts cannot be balanced and the answer is not accurate? the answer is wrong using the dot down method!

the following is a message on the crp5 handbook pg 33

A WORD OF WARNING FOR CPL/ATPL STUDENTS

An alternative way of solving this problem has its advocates who claim that their method is easier because it does not require any moving of the computer to balance the drifts. unfortunately their method requires the wv to be marked on the window in reverse and the learning of a completely new set of rules. furthermore, unlike the professionals' method described above, their method cannot be used to solve all other types of problems. the cpl/atpl student is strongly advised to stick with the methods in this handbook and avoid getting involved with limited use short-cuts, particularly if they require committing non-standard procedures to memory.

  Comment: please review this question

1. effective TAS: cos(sin-1(wind/TAS)) x TAS = 177.48
2. GS: cos(40) x wind (30) = -22.98 (HWC) + 177.48 = 154.49
3. XWC using CR-3: sin(40) x 30 (wind) = 19.28 --> closest Drift: 6 deg

  Comment: Flying east = odd FL
According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for an easterly magnetic track, Odd FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft must be followed.
minimum safe altitude along the whole route is 7 200 ft. But that would be FL750. But that is not an option, so let’s find which one is:

It has to be Odd, so:

Even / Odd
FL650 / FL750
FL850 / FL950

Only option FL950

Question Number: AT00029
- Name: hahahahaha
  Comment: The solution is incorrect.

Considering the case of MLM
- DOM + Traffic + Fuel on board - Fuel penalty= 122550+43217 +(51616-45854)-(51616-45854)/1000*394 = 169258

The loadable weight considering MLM = 182000-169258 = 12741
-> considering the fuel penalty, the full fuel = 12741/1000*394+12741 = 17760

Loadable weight under MTOM = 233000 - 43127 - 51616 = 15617 < 17760

so the answer is 15617 kgs, not 14597 kgs.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @hahahahaha. The explanation and option are correct.
Maximum landing mass (MLM) - Actual landing mass = MLM - (Actual take-off mass - trip fuel) = MLM - (Dry operating mass + Traffic load + Planned take-off fuel - Trip fuel) = 182 000 kg - (122 550 kg + 43 217 kg + 51 616kg - 45 854 kg) = 182 000 kg - 171 529 kg = 10 471 kg
Increased Trip Fuel = 394 x (10 471 / 1 000) = 4 125 kg
10 471 + 4 125 = 14 597 kg
- Name: moczymorda
  Comment: calculated it twice, i would go for 15617. It is within limits.
- Name: Jor117
  Comment: 15617kg is correct, as it's within MLM after the extra full penalty
- Name: dichko
  Comment: Just try with 15617 kg:
New ATOM = DOM + TL + TOF (initial) + EF
New ATOM = 122550 + 43217 + 51616 + 15617 = 233000 (right into the limits)
New Fuel Penalty (FP) = 15617/1000x394 = 6153 => New Trip Fuel (TF) = 45854 + 6153 = 52007 kg
LM = ATOM - TF = 233000 - 52007 = 180993 kg (MLM = 182000 kg)
I think Fuel Penalty should apply on what is extra compared to the initial plan. In our case only Extra Fuel.

  Comment: please have a look to olivier comment, because the method you use is wrong since you apply the correction to the remaining extra fuel at destination and not the one you have at takeoff. Is this answer based on actual feedback ?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @AlessandroB. Yes, this answer is based on actual feedback. We apply the correction to the difference between the maximum landing mass and the actual landing mass, not to the extra fuel at the destination. Because the maximum amount of discretionary fuel is limited by the maximum landing mass (MLM) in this question. Thank you for your comment.

  Comment: What happens if it exceeded MTOW after adding fuel penalty?
- Name: yahya777
  Comment: All Comments Are not understandable to me

** we have to find most limited Tom**

1- Tom from landing mass ( MLM + trip )=227854 ==> smaller then Mtom
2- find actual tom ( Dom+TL+ToF)=217383

** we can take-off and land with tom from landing mass (227854kg)**
** but actual tom that is currently available is less then then that we get from LM**
** so we can carry extra fuel or any load that is (LM tom - Actual tom )= 10471kg

3- We will get 10471kg By subtracting Limited Tom Getting from LM with Actual TOM

** Apply penalty on 10471 kg

4- Penalty on 10000 => ( 10X394 = 3940kg , and for remaining 470kg that will be less then the Half of 394 =>186
5- Total penalty 3940+186=4126
Penalty of extra load + Extra load ( 4126+10471)=14588kg

  Comment: but with that amount of extra fuel, we are way above our Regulated TOM (RTOM) with MLM+TF.. so why is it correct if it is not allowed to Take off with that amount of fuel?
- Name: Adolph
  Comment: @Pawel when they ask for maximum possible extra fuel, MZFM is never limiting, so the only 3 values that limit your fuel will be MTOM, MLM, and maximum possible fuel according to the tank capacity.
Keep in mind that fuel penalty is ONLY applied to the extra fuel possible at from LANDING calculations; then you just select the most limiting value from the 3 numbers you get
- Name: Pawel
  Comment: Could You explain why in some quiestions (like No. 338671) we have to calcuate the most limiting MTOM and other questions like this one, we just skip this part and move to calculations for extra fuel? And also if we check the most limiting MTOM why don't we check the option MZFM+ T/O fuel? Thanks in advance
- Name: iloveeasa69
  Comment: Hi , please check your answer again. If we bring 15,617 kgs of extra fuel at take-off, my fuel burn penalty is 15,617/1,000 x 394 = 6,153. Then at landing, my landing mass will be DOM+Traffic Load+Planned T/O Fuel + Extra Fuel (15,617) - Planned Trip - Fuel Penalty = 122550 + 51616 + 43217 + 15617 - 45854 - 6153 = 180993, which is LESS than the maximum landing weight.

  Comment: I passed M&B with 89% but I feel like a beginner when I do this..
- Name: winaol
  Comment: The proposed method to calculate the fuel penalty is not correct. A simple cross-check: applying the fuel penalty of 394 kg/ton to the 14956 kg of extra fuel gives a penalty of 5750 kg, so the landing fuel will be 8845 kg, which is lower than our target max landing fuel of 10471 kg. This is because the extra fuel of 4125 kg used to carry the 10471 kg will in turn generate a fuel penalty of 1625 kg, which will cause an extra burn of 640 kg, and so on (252, 99, 39, 15, 6, 2, 1), for a total of 6804 kg.
So, the max extra fuel limited by MLM is 17275 kg, which could have been calculated directly so : 10471/(1-0,394) as described by Paolo in an earlier message.
As this exceeds the 15617 kg allowed by the MTOM limit, that value becomes the max allowable tanker on take-off.

  Comment: @atplq I think this answer is wrong, I leaned that for fuel penalty you should calculate it this way:

FP= 1000-394/1000 = 0,606 (every extra fuel I carry at landing I would have 0,606 kg)
maximum extra fuel at landing/FP

If you apply this formula you should get 17278,8
Is this an old question? has it appeared recently?
- Name: Pawel
  Comment: Here you should not exceed MTOM while starting (with penalty fuel still not burnt) and MLM while landing (when penalty is burnt, additionaly to planned Trip Fuel).

Limit (A) => MTOM - Actual Take Off gives underload = 15 617 kg (penalty not burnt)
Limit (B) => MLM - Actual LM gives underload = 10 471 kg (penalty burnt)

Our weight sums are:
1. DOM: 122 550 kg
2. Traffic Load: 43 217 kg
3. Remaing of planned T/O Fuel (T/O Fuel - Trip Fuel) 51 616 kg - 45 854 kg = 5 762 kg
4. Extra fuel after burining penalty, one of two options:

(A) For Take Off limited Underload*: 15 617 kg*_______After burining penalty______=> 11 202 kg
(B) Landing limited Underload*: 14 597 kg _______After burining penalty______=> 10 471 kg*

While both variants don't exceed MTOM (233 000kg), for MLM (182 000):
- (A) 122 550 + 43 217 + 5 762 + 11 202 = 182 731
- (B) 122 550 + 43 217 + 5 762 + 10 417 = 181 946
Only (B) fits, so maximum Extra Fuel including any penalty that can be load without exceeding limits is:

14 597 kg.
- Name: Jon
  Comment: DOM + TRAFFIC LOAD + TAKE OFF FUEL = TOM
122550 + 43217 + 51616 = 217383

Find the Take Off Underload by subtracting this from MTOM:
233000 - 217383 = 15617

TOM - TRIP FUEL = LM
217383 - 45854 = 171529

Landing Underload = MLM - LM
182000 - 171529 = 10471

Take the lowest of our Take Off or Landing Underload. In this case 10471 as it's smaller than 15617.

Apply the fuel penalty = (10471/1000)*394 = 4125.57

Add this to our Landing Underload. 10471 + 4125.57 = 14597.

Double check this fits in the tank - yes loads of room. So 14597 is the answer

  Comment: Sorry to bother you with this, @ATPLQ, but I think it would really be useful for the questions which were seen in an official exam, but have no comments (so that we are able to make an idea if it was recent or not), we also had the approximate date when they have been reported.

  Comment: maybe some of you would like to impress themselves with what they already know and end up with a wrong answer. remember ICET. a looked at given data, spotted flight level (felt like a winner already) and treated TAS like IAS and applied 2%/1000ft correction. EASA anticipated and gave the result of my way of thinking as one of the answers! obviously wrong. good luck and keep it simple ;)

  Comment: Hi guys. This question only asks for “VFR arrivals to Dubrovnik” and the correct answer is 5. We believe that the question you encountered in your official exams and whose answer is 10 is the question in the database with question number 337414, which asks “How many visual procedures are published?”
We also believe that your feedback on the options may be related to question 337414. We will therefore continue to monitor your feedback to update relevant questions. Thank you all for your valuable feedback.

2 options were something like '5 bi-directional at 1500' or '10 bidirectional at 1500'' and another one '10 total, 1500' altitude for departure and 1000' if flying inbound'.

I chose the '5 bi-directional at 1500'.

  Comment: I dont believe it was different, but Ill give you the benefit of the doubt. Nonetheless for the UK it was clear 5000kg , which was marked correct.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @SimonC with the numbers given in the question, there is no doubt that the correct answer is 4000 kg. The graph is more than clear and not even an interpolation is required. Of course, a combination of different numbers may lead to a 5000 kg answer. We are looking forward to receiving further feedback.

- Name: Imran289
  Comment: please check this. The question asked specifically for the MAXIMUM amount that can be tankered, that would be 10,000kg. Not the optimum tankering of 4000kg. Taking the already 30T onboard to 40T (the max capacity). This is also within MLM limits.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hey guys, thank you for your comments! We have updated the question text. If anyone comes across this question in their official exam, kindly let us know where they ask for the optimum or maximum amount of fuel which may be tankered. Thank you and best of luck with your exams!
- Name: Hossein123
  Comment: basically, this is just 1 new step to what you already know if you finished the previous fuel section

find the limit in, and take the lowest:
MTM - ATM
MLM - ALM
F.T - fuel.total

but now our new step is to use the graph and apply fuel ratio from the left, go right to our NM and go down to our optimum weight
subtract optimum weight and our take off mass = 4000

so, find the lowest in:
MTM - ATM
MLM - ALM
FC - FL
OW - ATM

Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) is a generic expression, used in various cases to denote an altitude below which it is unsafe to fly owing to presence of terrain or obstacles. An ICAO definition of the term "minimum safe altitude" as such does not exist.
- Name: tecnamodi
  Comment: Comment from @rixii really solved all MSA questions from me. Just add/subtract 180 to the radial and it makes it much simpler when trying to find which direction you're coming from. Big credits to him
- Name: Toaster
  Comment: Also if you're not sure which side of 60° to go, remember headings clockwise from north so 63 will be in 5900 sector not 3500.
- Name: Toaster
  Comment: I like others kept getting this wrong but then realised it's actually quite easy, you just add or subtract 180° to get the radial and match it to a sector. I think I got this on my first attempt and it was 2 points in austro.
- Name: AnuBoswell
  Comment: This one got me, 243 radial. -180 = 63 degrees! Which puts you in the 5900' side! Be careful!

- Name: PabloPIC
  Comment: Does anybody else understands from the question that the aircraft is tracking radial 243 TO the VOR? Or am I getting confused with the question wording?
- Name: Kokoszka17
  Comment: To everyone saying it should be 3500 - unfortunately not and I was thinking the same thing as you until I studied the MSA picture a bit more. If you look at the approach following R175 and R355 you'll notice that they are 180 degrees apart which divides the circle in two. HOWEVER radials 60 and 245 are NOT 180 degrees apart but 185 degrees which makes the 2 halves of the circle uneven. Therefore R243 is a reciprocal of R63 which is unfortunately still in the 5900 MSA sector.

This chart was carefully chosen by EASA because of the tricky MSA sector divide which probably fooled many pilots.
- Name: rixii
  Comment: Maybe try to convert it to headings.

R243 - 180 = 063 heading towards the VOR which places it in 5900ft sector between headings 060 to 175 degrees.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Ran, radial 243 is in the sector between radial 240 and 355. The sector is designated with the headings 060 and 175 respectively.
- Name: Dennis
  Comment: It should be 3500
- Name: The struggle
  Comment: The answer should be 3500ft as the 243 radial would be extending into that section. The explanation would state more than 245 degrees.

Do not confuse, the GNSS must be check before departure, when you are planning the flight, AT or FOR the time you will need to use , in this case at IAF.

The most correct answer would be, GNSS must be check before departure FOR the time/at the time you will use.

- Name: DennisBertram
  Comment: Could you explain when you start with the pressure correction and when you start with the temperature correction?

This changes between each question.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @DennisBertram. It depends on whether you're converting from true altitude to pressure altitude or vice versa. You can clearly see the sequence of corrections in the figure attached to the explanation.
For example, if you're given a true altitude and need to convert it to pressure altitude, the steps are as follows:
1. Apply the temperature correction to the true altitude to get the indicated altitude.
2. Then apply the pressure correction to the indicated altitude to obtain the pressure altitude.
To go from pressure altitude to true altitude, you simply reverse the process.
Hope this helps!

Now what ? True altitude above an elevation is the True Altitude if the sea was as high as the elevation ? Question should clearly ask for height or absolute altitude above ground.

- Name: Niklas2002
  Comment: i think you misunderstood me here a bit. The question you created did not appear in my exam. It actually was exactly this question, the only difference was the wording.

Instead of asking: What is the approximate height above the airfield datum?
The LBA question asked: what is the true altitude above the aerodrome datum?

One possible answer was: 2330ft
The other possible answer was: 3680ft (which can be close enough to T.Alt, especially when using 27ft/hp)

I appealed the question but i dont know which answer they consider as correct

  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL). In this case, the airfield elevation is said to be 1 416 ft, and it must be taken into account for the temperature correction.
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

- Name: Harrison
  Comment: Did this a different way and got the same answer.

1. Calculate new TAS by comparing new leg times. 36 mins (old total for everything post failure) divided by 47 mins gives 0.766. 0.766 X 130 (planned TAS) gives 100 knots.

2. Compare new fuel flow. 207/211.7 gives 97.78%.

So we are flying a lot slower for approximately the same fuel consumption.

  Comment: But the whole calculation doesn't sum up. Even if we had not slowed down beween VJF and Tarifa, with the current FF we would have landed with 83kg in the Tanks, not 120kg. It's not clear what this Q wants from us. I calculated different scenarios but had the A/C not decreased speed, the FF would have been bigger (164kg/h) and with remaining 48 minutes before VJF we would have landed with 75,8 kg or with remaining 36 minutes after Tarifa we would have landed with 108,5 kg. All of this is less than the estimated 120kg. So with our revised FF of 141 kg/h we will land with 97kg which is in the middle of the 3 calculated values.

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @CharlieBravo. We need the actual values of consumption and not the estimated ones. The beginning and ending times of the period when 40 kg of actual fuel was consumed are indicated in red boxes in the annex in the explanation section. These times are 15:51 and 16:08 and the difference between them is 17 minutes. Therefore, the explanation is correct. Thank you for your comment.

  Comment: from position vjf to tariff 17 minutes flight time and fuel used 40 kg ,

so 40 divided 17 minutes , 2.35 kg per minute ,

2.35 x 47 =110 kg, now add all the fuel legs equal 223 plus 110 equals 333 kg,

now subtract (actual after speed slow) 333 with (estimated) 309 we will have 24 kg difference and yes here is the answer.. ..

- Name: Ezequiel
  Comment: As the last comment said, use the logic! The question states that from Tarifa to LEMG now it's estimated in 47 mins, add those 47 mins to the last WPT ATO (16:08), it will give an ETA to LEMG at 16:55. NOW, compare this ETA to the original planned umsing the T/O time, this result will give you 16:37 PLANNED ETA, you will now see that your flight time will be LONGER! There's one possible answer. Hope it helps! :)

All 4 answers gave different times for both sectors i just mentioned. one of the answers was 23 minutes for both distances (thats what i took) and no answer was even close to 23 minutes.. all of them like 11 or 7 minutes or something like that..
All in all i would say about 75% ATPL Q coverage but with the knowledge of these examples here absolutely doable.

But there is really an easy way to solve it:

Question Number: AT00043
- Name: Muhammedkasem
  Comment: Shouldn't we select FL 7000, and this is where the trick lies. FL 6000 would certainly provide the greatest SGR (Specific Ground Range), but it is not among the permitted flight levels. The next altitude that gives the highest SGR is FL 7000, which is within the allowed flight levels, so it should be selected.

I would appreciate any feedback from the exam or the team.e
- Name: Ilaymad
  Comment: No need to calculate, look for the highest GS.
I chose 7,000 ft because there is a minimum height requirement. Surely appealable!

  Comment: IAA 26/06/2025 only 10,000 was listed as the maximum altitude as well as the 7000ft minimum.

- Name: DRMode
  Comment: The only way I can see an appeal for 7000' failing is because the question states "What altitude provides the highest ground milage per GPH?" and does not imply that you actually have to fly at that altitude, just calculate the figure.

In real life I would not even consider calculating an altitude I cannot fly at, but it is EASA asking here and we all know that their thinking is not logical.

  Comment: SInce the Fuel Flow of 15.5GPH is the same at all altitudes, as the question itself is telling us, yes, as @SKyDweller said, we just need to search for the highest GS since it will give us the best "milleage" on a specific consumption. (Not neccesarly the lowest headwind as we could have a higher TAS to compensate!) If the FF were to vary between altitudes, then we would divide the GS by the appropriate FF to find the miles flown with that specific consumption at that specific speed.

I personally did not need it in the FP exam. Got everything for my questions printet on Din A3 from the Examination Centre. Think it depends where you plan to write your exam, so check that, and if you are unsure, take it with you.
For Performance and Mass/Balance i recommend, take CAP698 and CAP696 with you if you are allowed.

  Comment: I also found exactly the same question of Alex44 on my exam with Austro today 6 November 24
- Name: Alex44
  Comment: Austro Vienna Update 05.11.24 (2 Pointer Question)
The Minimum Altitude is 4000 ft not 6000ft!

The question is different than here. First of all you get a table Annex with different power settings ( 75%, 65% and 55%) the question asked about the 75%. So choose that table. Then you have 3 Headwinds:
4000 feet 3 kt
6000 feet 6kt
8000 feet 9kt

The TAS you find in the Table. But you only get 6000feet and 8000feet straight. For 5000 feet and 7000 feet you need to interpolate.

I got those:
5000 feet ( dont remeber but was clearly lower)
6000 feet GS 174 kt
7000 feet GS 173,5kt
8000 feet GS 173,5 kt

The Answers were
A: 5000 feet
B: 6000 feet ( correct one like marked here)
C: 7000 feet
D: 8000 feet
So now i think the question is good to go.

By the way the Flight Planning subject was very Banky. I had 4-5 new questions but the Calculations were like in training, nothing bad to expect. Good Luck!

Item 35 - MOCA refers to 4500T on the opposite page (So 5000T correct answer for this question)
- Name: MattMad
  Comment: Explanation is wrong!
Find Jeppesen Introduction pdf for free. Page 61.

MOCA is Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude, example 5000T
I remember it as C like Clearance to obsTruction, so it's about T letter accent.

MORA is Minimum Off-Route Altitude, example 4000a
I remember it as MORAAA, so the little "a" after the altitude.

MEA is Minimum Enroute Altitude, example 6000
It's without anything more.

MAA is Maximum Authorised Altitude, example MAA7000
Its with MAA letters, so no problem.

- Name: ricardgalisteo
  Comment: For people who can't memorize:
All charts are oriented to true north, which means that IFR and VFR charts will point in that direction, so the chart does not need to "rotate" over time, now for a HEADING GIVEN in a chart they are all MAGNETIC

More context:
VORs are built heading true north, but potentiometer adjustment is used to make its radials match with magnetic north. ALL headings in JEPPSEN or IFR routes are like this. Look for charts oriented to magnetic north, it's hard to find any because that'd split Canada in half. This also doesn't make all charts de facto "obsolete" every time magnetic north changes, and so it is only needed to apply the correction. Also because not all aircraft have the ability to follow true headings or even if you have the ability, for most utility airplanes is not that precise

- Name: Nickyp1982
  Comment: Can someone please explain why the variation is 3w and not 4w? In the explaination it says the variation is running straight through the airway where actually w004 is running through the centre. Also Norbo is close to 5w and Talla is close to 3w (on the 4w side) so I took the average which would be 4w. many thanks

So same answers, wind direction just to fool you.
- Name: MrATPL
  Comment: The course on the chart is given as magnetic.

Since we APPLY THE VARIATION AT THE VOR, and not at the A/C we do the following.

1. On the chart read of the variation in the area of the VOR (which is 3W).
2. Apply the variation on the magnetic course given on the map from NORBO (TH = MH + Var -> TH = 99 + -3 = 96).

Therefore the answer is not 95 or 99 but 96.

Question Number: AT00049
- Name: KNekrasovs
  Comment: @FlyerDaniel yeah, in this subject MZFM+trip is never considered and I do not know why.
- Name: FlyerDaniel
  Comment: the question and the resolution are a joke: MZFM + TOF (assumed BF) = 2300kg. So 2300 is maximum allowed TOM. The actual TOM is also 2300, so no possible fuel!!
- Name: CaptainMarius
  Comment: The allowed take-off mass is the lowest of
MSTOM
PLTOM
MSLM+TRIP FUEL=2390kg
PLTOM+TRIP FUEL
MZFM+TOF(NOT USED for extra fuel calculations)
regulated take-off mass (rtom) is the lowest of the "performance limited" tom and "structural limited" tom.=3000kg
so we are taking the 2390 since is the lowest value.
next we calculate our actual take off mass 2000+300=2300(we would take taxi fuel out but we dont know it so we skip it)
therefore our extra weight we can take is 2390-2300=90 kg(in this case of fuel)
lets check based on our tank capacity- 550-300=250kg we can take, but we are limited by the muslim+trip fuel, so we take the lowest value which is 90kg of extra fuel we can take.
- Name: CaptainMarius
  Comment: Regulated Take-Off Mass (RTOM) is the lowest of the "performance limited" TOM and "structural limited" TOM.
- Name: FlyingKuba
  Comment: Only 200kg difference between ATOM and permitted landing mass so:
300 - 190 = 110 - this is value of fuel when we landed
200-110 = 90kg - we can only uplift 90kg because landing mass limit us.
- Name: Sonacapilot
  Comment: This type of questions for sure are a joke for us! So, now we have to assume Block fuel = TOF Fuel? why?
- Name: RotorRider
  Comment: @fly9fly, could be a helicopter or a bush plane the landed on a dirt road (no taxi fuel needed) -> so Block fuel = Take-off fuel

Answer was 400kg, RTOM limited. Tank limit was 450.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello, @Dani! I want to express my gratitude for your feedback. By any chance, do you remember the MLM? Additionally, was the tank capacity mentioned in the question 450 kg or 900 kg? Having this additional information will greatly assist us in creating a more accurate question. Thank you so much!
- Name: flyingaua
  Comment: Austro Vienna exactly the same 31.05.2023
- Name: Assan
  Comment: ATPLQ shouldnt we use MTOM instead of RTOM in your explanation as its more restricting?

RTOM = 3000

MTOM = 2390 which is MLM + Trip Fuel?

The correct answer is still 90kg
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hey @Assan, the maximum take-off mass would have to be provided by the question. You can't assume it like that :)
- Name: Aiman
  Comment: again with the assume
- Name: Luke
  Comment: I guess we just parked on the runway as there is no taxi fuel
- Name: Grant
  Comment: @ATPL Questions - The answer should be zero uplift due to insufficient information. It is a dangerous precedent to set, to assume BLOCK Fuel = T/O Fuel given that two of the answers are only 30kg different which is easily the taxi fuel in a light aircraft in this example and when you get to the heavy jets, taxi fuel gets into the hundreds of kilograms and sometimes into the thousands, one should NEVER assume BLOCK Fuel = T/O Fuel. This is a very poor question.
- Name: ATPL
  Comment: Appeared ULC Poland 10.11, 2 points.
Thanks ATPLQ a lot, today i passed this bloody subject with 94.83%.
RNAV, Human, Airframes and Ops to go!
- Name: LukaSz
  Comment: ZERO Fuel = 2000
Add 300 min fuel = 2300
you will burn 190 of 300 which makes you: 2300 - 190 when landing = 2110
2200 is your max mass for landing which allows you add extra 90 kg

Then check 2300 TOF + 90 = 2390
It is not higher than RTOM 3000
390 in tanks is not higher than capacity 500
- Name: Angelina
  Comment: There are few steps, that can help us to calculate extra fuel, and pick the lowest value, as it limits.
1. Tank capacity- block fuel = 550 kg-300 kg= 250 kg, Limit 1
2. MLM- Actual LM= (Actual LM in our case is AZFM + TOF - Trip fuel), therefore 2200 kg - (2000+300-190)= 90 kg, Limit 2
3. MTOM - Actual TOM ( no data for this limit)
So, conclusion is 90 kg, that can be taking extra in our case.

Hope it helps, if anyone has different way of solving it, please share.

practically the topic of my question regarding the codes about "localizer" and "local". in the explanation you wrote as code of localizer= llz while the code to indicate local = loc.

  Comment: @MC12345
NAM or Nautical AIR miles, is the amount of AIR that you cover in a specific time. Wind has no effect on NAM. It's like the distance that the air travels around/through you and it can be viewed also as endurance, the time you can be "in air."
NGM or Nautical ground miles, is the amount of GROUND that you cover in a specific time. Wind has an effect on NGM and it's, usually, called range. It is the range in km/miles etc. that you can cover on ground.

NGM is dependant on your GS. So if you have a tailwind, you'll cover more ground since your GS will be higher, it will "push" you ahead. If you have headwind, you'll cover less ground, it will (literally) "slow" you down since your GS will be smaller.
As for the NAM, it may help you to visualize, imagine yourself in a wind tunnel. The air is flowing "onto" you. you'll be still, so you are not going to any ground miles, but the air that is flowing onto you will be traveling some air miles. I just hope it was enough, I've tried.

- Name: Joachim
  Comment: @Tomasz, So because this is a specific procedure "isolated aerodrome", we actually do not carry Final Reserves as we included it into the additional fuel for this procedure, which is 2h at cruise consumption over the destination aerodrome.
- Name: Tomasz
  Comment: maybe is a silly question.

But I'm trying to fully understand PDP procedure

what does it mean "including final reserve fuel"??

Are we adding Final reserve fuel (30min in this case) on top of these 2h additional or those 2h additional fuel have 30min FR fuel included) so we don't need to add 30 min.

Hopefully, I expressed myself clearly.

Thanks in advance

- Name: Mahdy
  Comment: TAS increased by 10 = 457
Fuel flow increased by 3% of 1086 = 1118
time = ( 310 / (457 - 25) ) * 1118 * 2 (because 2 engines) = 1604 kg
- Name: Extrafuel
  Comment: This part of your explanation is NOT correct

"With a 25 kt headwind, the groundspeed will be 451 - 25 = 426 kt. Applying the note, the TAS must be increased by 1 kts for each degree above standard TAT. So, it becomes: 426 + 10 = 436 kt"

- It should be, the TAS given from the table "451kts" +10kts for the TAT difference. And then 461kts TAS - 25kts HWC, which will give us the GS 436kts.
- Name: deltaalpha
  Comment: @Maximus18 in the end it's completely irrelevant if you first add 10 and then substract 25 (either +10-25 or -25+10 is the same result). The same with Fuel Flow, since you multiply everything, it's irrelevant wheter you first multiply by 2 and 0.71 and then by 3% or the other way around (principle: 2x3 is the same as 3x2).
Yes you're approach is more structured and logical, and I recommend you to apply it like you did because if you mix a summation with a multiplication, then the result will be wrong.

  Comment: @Billy you get punished for a 36 seconds adjustment. Also you round up for just 6 seconds. Which means that the actual change in a real life scenario is irrelevant. So rounding up or down should still make you get the right answer. As i said, answers are too close for an actual LO.

TAS=Mach*38.95*sqr.root temp in K.
456.7=0.76*38.95*sqr.root (273-35)

Then headwind component = Cos(relative wind angle)*wind velocity.

  Comment: FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT HAVE CRP5:
1. TAS = mach x LSS = 0.76 x 38.35 x square root of oat + 273. TAS= 449 - 64HW = 385 KT (GS)
2. TIME = 90NM/385KT = 0.23H = 14 MIN.
3. 14:58 H + 00:14 h = 15:12 h

  Comment: I too was getting a time of 13 minutes. However, I read Andre's comment and saw he used mach 0.76. I immediately disliked and said he is being ridiculous because the question clearly states mach 0.8. Then I re-read the question, and it was I who was being ridiculous. The mach is reduced to 0.76 which outputs a time of 14 minutes.
I'm sorry for doubting you Andre.

  Comment: @jonathan, in these sorts of problems wind is usually giving in true. So its like using doing conversions, you have to make sure you use the same units. Either putting the magnetic track into true or the wind into magnetic will allow you to use the same units. But with such a small difference in variation, you should be able to get the correct answer either way! :)

  Comment: I do not understand Andre's calculation from March. He uses the unrevised Mach number and mixes magnetic track with true wind. Is it ust accidentally the correct result or is there a scheme behind that?

When I try to do the calculations with the E6B I always end up with 13 minutes flight time as well so its a pity that the answer options are that close together to make the correct answer a matter of luck. In reality nobody would care about 1 minute error in ETA due to rounding issues as the sourrounding conditions like wind are not that constant anyway.

  Comment: Lawrence, not sure about you but Ive passed Meteo and Gnav exams without a problem and had this type of question in both of them. Ive used algebra every time as I found that I occasionally make an error with the computer whereas I never seem to make an error when I use the Mach formula M = TAS/LSS (and for temp -*2 degrees per 1000ft until -56.5 for ISA). I also use trig for wind correction angles as I find the calculator to be faster than the flight computer and also less prone to errors. That leaves the computer just for calcs like compressibility, TAS -> CAS etc. Each one has his way to skin a cat but thats my way.

  Comment: Ok, but why write the wrong time in the table?
11 min for LIBLO to BTA..
Sometimes they want us to calculate and other times to take from the table..
I assumed that it wasn't a full minute (i.e., 11.5 min) and they rounded it down, so the whole calculation relied on it.
- Name: MayorTom
  Comment: Question (what are the new ETAs) , answer = actual GS and added to Actual time , freaking awesome this is madness
- Name: DrPilot
  Comment: The trick here is the wording. At first, you'd think that they want you to use the here already provided GS and to calculate the answer that is ALSO provided among the options, but it's wrong. They want you to use the ACTUAL IN FLIGHT (as per wording..) GS that is NOT provided, so you have to calculate it. Then, they want you to assume that, that GS, will be the same for the next leg just because they "made it clear" by putting in the corresponding box the same 190kt GS value, which is, btw, the wrong one and should not be used. Then, when you make all the necessary calculations by using every single decimal, since the precision IS important, you have to approx. by -3.43 seconds for the first choice and +13.71 seconds for the second choice.Why is this important? Because by approx. during the calculation process, you'll end up with 1 min difference and you'll end up getting the wrong option if you just "trust it." Now, already 1 min diff. is crazy but this.. I just thank God, for he has given me enough patience and strength to keep on laughing at this question even after I have failed it, twice..

Liblo to BTA =12 min for 35 NM =175 kt

13 min times 1.086 =14 min

  Comment: SEEN IN SPAIN with this index and the chart, asking for distances between two positions and the ETAs

  Comment: Much easier way:
From the leg LIBLO-BTA (where the wind is the same as to ELB and UPDADU) do:
Actual Time of Arrival (ATA)/Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)=12/11=1.091. This is your ratio for how much longer each leg takes than planned.
So then for the legs asked: BTA-ELB Estimated leg time: 13minsx1.091 = 14 mins Atual leg time
Leg ELB-UPDAU = 2x1.091=2.182 (not increased enough to be significant)
Then new eta's: 13:31+14=13:45, +2 @elb, +2 =13:47 @upadu

- Name: Subzero
  Comment: Question is asking for ETA and were calculating ATA, aviation makes no sense.

I Never thought I'd get this question wrong lol, if we use the explaination logic than will have to check the whole table time cause maybe they are wrong but our mistake was not checking the previous leg, something very easy but they make it soo complicated damn.

So question asked for the Actual GS, just so you can know nothing in the Table is actual so i think thats how you spot the mistake, this question has constant wind if it wasn't than you'd have to calculate GS for each leg, cause as i mentioned we are looking for actual GS.

-If you still didn't understand just imagine all the GS given in the question are wrong, treat it this way than you'll be able to answer it fast because you know what is the error.

Hope this helps in understanding it abit clear.

  Comment: Daniels explanation works!
- Name: Daniel
  Comment: since i couldn't find any proper explanation of altimetry so far, and really struggled to understand that, im gonna leave my interpretation of what ive gathered so far.

fat pedos touch tom (fptt):
flight lvl -> correct pressure -> then temp -> get true altitude (to get true altitude from flight lvl)
-> to get the flight level from true altitude just follow it the opposite way (first temp, then pressure)

pressure correction:
qnh > isa = subtract
qnh < isa = add

temp. correction (only apply the value from the difference between meteo station and air column)
temp > isa = subtract
temp < isa= add

note that the above is just for when you try to find the flight level from true altitude. if youre trying to get the true altitude from a fl, just applg the oppisite . (ex. temp > isa = add)

In case I forgot anything, or got something wrong please correct me.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL). In this case, the airfield elevation is said to be 875 ft, and it must be taken into account for the temperature correction.
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

  Comment: @Riccardo The way I think about it is: If ISA DEV is colder then it means that I am lower than I think. And if ISA DEV is hotter, I am higher than I think. And after that, I make a mental image of what needs to be done. Here I need to convert to FL, So if I am higher than I think I am, that means I can subtrakt the extra height because I am already higher up. Makes sense?
You have to be careful about when to add and when to subtract.

  Comment: at what altitude is the temp measured at?
- Name: Riccardo
  Comment: TA = 4385 + 1500 = 5885

TA = PA + 30 x (QNH - STD PRESS.) + (4/1000 x ISA DEV x AIR COLUMN)
5885 = PA + 30 x ( 12 ) + ( 4/1000 x 12 x 5010 )
5885 - 360 - 240 = PA
PA = 5284

So minimum safe FL will be FL060 because on FL050 you will be flying 284ft under your safety altitude.

  Comment: TA = 4385 + 1500 = 5885 ft
QNH correction = 1025 - 1013 = 12 hpa (12*30= 360 ft)
TA = 5885 - 360 = 5525 ft
Temp correction TA = IA + or - ( 4*Delta ISA * height above elevation/1000)
5525 - 875 = 4650 / 1000 = 4.65 ft
5525 = IA + (4*12*4.65)
IA = 5525 - 223 = 5302 FT

flight time ( 18:43 - 18:06= 37) at a fuel consumption of 45kg : 0.72 = 62.5 L/ h

(62.5/60) x 37 = 38.5 l REQUIRED TO REGAIN THE TRACK and reach TUSKA

You can also follow the N57 airway and see that it says 161*, add 180 to that and you get 341!

Good luck in exams everyone!

  Comment: Between TRENT (VOR) & POLE HILL (VOR) is Airway N57. It shows a total length of 44NM.

Pole Hill - Denby = 14NM
Denby - Tipil = 23NM
(14NM + 23NM = 37NM)

44NM (total length) - 37NM (Pole Hill-Tipil) = 7NM (Tipil-Trent)

just another way to figure this question out, based on the nautical mile.

Question Number: AT00066
- Name: MajsPL
  Comment: From PadPilot, Additional Fuel has to be included if:
- no destination alternate nominated for procedures contingency 5% or 3%ERA. So with this case alternate fuel=additional fuel, wich is fuel for 15 min hold on 1500ft AGL on holding FF
- if it is anticipated that for some reason it is nesesery to include extra fuel for cases like extra fuel consumption in case of flight level drop due to engine failure or loss of cabin pressure to flight to alternate and hold there for 15 min on 1500ft AGL. This could be case for high certified ETOPS flights.

In this example we have additional fuel enforced on us so it is required to carry on flight. This is convoluted, so If there is mistake please correct me.

  Comment: all this while, all the other questions which were similar did not ask for additional fuel, but why is additional fuel suddenly included in the calculations here? Question 335816 is also similar, except that it is a MRJT in that question. Additional fuel was not included in the calculations there. So what exactly is the difference here? There is alternate fuel here. So far, the general rule has been that if there is alternate fuel, additional fuel is not needed - and this is also mentioned in a number of your explanations for other questions (Question 335497 couldn't make this any clearer). I really hope you can address this question because a lot of students here are also asking the same question and it is not being addressed. Thanks.

  Comment: For anybody who is confused:

Generally, it's true that when you need additional you don't need alternate fuel, and vice versa, WITH ONE EXCEPTION:

ETOPS flights! During ETOPS operations, you carry alternate fuel (because you might still need to go to the alternate when you're done crossing the ocean and you reach your destination) but you also may need to carry additional fuel if the ETOPS enroute alternate is far enough (it's a whole science how to calculate it, thankfully it's not in the syllabus).

As you'll see, the question clearly states with the LONG RANGE jet transport - it's giving you a hint!

So you have to interpolate between 0 ISA and +20 ISA. furthermore interpolate the KTAS between 6000 & 8000 ft. I got 170 TAS. They gave you wind in true, but track in mag so need to do CDMVT. Then find drift using CRAP-5. My answer was 12 degrees right. Good luck guys!!

Question Number: AT00069
- Name: TiagoLH
  Comment: I was struggling with the pressure correction part of altimetry, but Ive finally found a method that works for me. It might not be the most "official" approach, but its helped me consistently get the right answers. Hopefully, it helps someone else too!

Step 1:What the Question Is Asking
In this example-> Pressure Altitude (PA).
The order of solving should go: PA<-IA<-TA
If you need to find TA, you'll go backwards through that chain: TA<-IA<-PA

Step 2: Temperature Correction (TA->IA)
Given:
Temp at the base is -25*°C so,
ISa deviation at 10000 ft = isa temp = 15 - (2x10) = -5°c
actual temp = -25°c so isa dev =-20°c
formula: IA = TA - [4 x (alt /1000) x isa dev]
ia = 8000 - [4 x 8 x (-20)]
ia = 8000 - (-640)
ia = 8640 ft
step 3: pressure correction (ia -> pa)
here's the trick i use:
pa = ia + (1013 - pressure at level) x 27 (If not specified we assume 30)
in this case: pa = 8640 + ((1013 - 990) x 27)
pa = 8640 + (23 x 27)
pa = 8640 + 621 = 9261 ft -> fl100

alternatively, if you go pa ia, reverse the formula:

ia = pa + (pressure at level - 1013) x 30

summary of the trick
when going from ia to pa, use:
pa = ia + (1013 - qnh) 30
when going from pa to ia, use:
ia = pa + (qnh - 1013) 30 - just flip the formula depending on the direction you're going.

- Name: RotorRider
  Comment: @Vitali hello again, The [ISA deviation] will be used to find our (TA)True Altitude. Since it is colder than ISA, our TA should be lower. Using a similar formula for temp.correction 4 x (8000'ft./1000) x [-20] = -640'ft // However, 8000'ft is our MSA, so we cannot be lower than this. Instead of subtracting the value, we add it -> 8640'ft (this is NOT yet a (PA)Pressure Altitude, as we are still using a QNH 990 hPa. The final step is to correct for the pressure setting difference! 990-1013 = 23hPa x 30' = +690 -> PA 9330' or the closest FL100
- Name: RotorRider
  Comment: @Vitalii, since the 'ISA deviation' isn't provided, we need to calculate it using information given. " temperature at FL100 is -25°C we will use this as our reference point: -> in ISA conditions the expected OAT would be 15-(10x2)= [-5°C], so the [ISA deviation is -20°C]

  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL).
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

  Comment: To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250) its from the explanation why this FL?
- Name: Jenu350
  Comment: true altitude calculation =. QNH is higher than standard we have to add(+), if QNH is lower than standard we have to subtract (-)
ISA deviation is (-) we have to subtract(-) , ISA deviation is (+) we have to add
first find the QNH then ISA deviation
- Name: CarloRomaFlyPe
  Comment: and some one please help me
why now added to indicated altitude
- Name: SportingFr
  Comment: Isnt warmer than ISA and so deduct from 17 700ft? instead of adding
- Name: Pilott
  Comment: For those who get confused not knowing which correction to apply first remember PIT and its always in the same order P I T or the opposite T I P if we are given true altitude and asked for pressure altitude or indicated altitude

P = Pressure altitude which is a flight level ( Reference 1013)
I = Indicated altitude which is the altitude given when QNH set
T = True altitude
Since you are given a pressure altitude and asked for true altitude you can't jump from P (pressure) to T (true) directly you have to first find I (Indicated)

So basically apply the pressure correction from 1013 to the actual QNH to find the indicated altitude & then go for the temprature correction

Hope this helps

  Comment: TA = IA + (Isa dev x 4/1000 x IA)

TA = 17700 +(10 x 4/1000 x 17700) = 18408

Keep it simple :)
- Name: sebwis
  Comment: @Christopher well in this case that might be true, but if you consider a higher QNH difference that might not always be the case, especially if we have a lower than standard QNH.
- Name: Vukasin
  Comment: 18000 + 30 x (1003 - 1013) + (4/1000 x 10 x 17700) = 18408

I used this formula

PA + 30 x (QNH - Standard Pressure) + (4/1000 x ISA DEV x Height Difference)

Could someone tell me why this method is not favored by others? I used it in gnav quite a lot and it was always correct. I know that in some questions in Flight Planning the result might not be as close but it is close enough.
- Name: Michael1010
  Comment: Why do you calculate ISA deviation with 18 000ft and not with 17 700ft?
- Name: Richard
  Comment: What is the correct method, should we apply temperature correction first or the pressure correction?
I've seen a few questions where it is temperature correction first and then pressure correction, but here it is the other way around.

In met I remember it was pressure correction first???
- Name: StephEDW
  Comment: Step by step:
1. Determine ISA-Deviation: 15 degress - (18x2 degrees) = - 21 degrees (=ISA) --> ISA-Deviation +10

2. Convert PA (=FL) into IA (=QNH): QNH set 1013, actual QNH 1003 --> 10x30ft = 300 ft --> if you turn on your altimeter from 1013 to 1003, it will read less altitude, therefore: FL180-300ft= 17700ft

3. IA to TA: IA (QNH) + Temp Error (4x Height Above Surface/100 x ISA-Dev) = 17700 + (4x17700/100x10) = 17700+708 = 18408ft

  Comment: @atplq WHY WHY WHY sometimes you apply the pressure correction and THEN the temperature correction ? sometimes you do the opposite and depend on this we get different results!
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Federico, to find true altitude from indicated altitude first pressure correction should be done then the temperature correction. If you are given the true altitude, you should do temperature correction at the beginning and then pressure correction. Hope it helps!
- Name: Ellis
  Comment: I don't know how accurately they would want this in a type-in. But using the equation 4 x ISA Dev x (H/1000) with the numbers: 4 x 9.4 x 17.7 the dev I get is 665.5, giving me a final answer of 18365.5 Would this be within the acceptable bounds do you think? I prefer not to round unless it's MDR, as you can always argue a more accurate answer.
- Name: AndreCamacho
  Comment: why sometimes we apply the temperature correction on the given value and sometimes to the value corrected already with the pressure correction?
I did 4 x 10 x 18 = +720
but in the explanation you did 4 x 10 x 17.7 = 708
which is slightly different. And in other exercises we apply the correction to the given value like i did, can someone explain?
- Name: Alexx1215
  Comment: @ATPLQ In some questions you first correct by temperature and in other first by pressure, which is the correct method?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Alessandro, to get true altitude first apply pressure correction then temperature correction. This is the correct order or the reverse when we are trying to determine a proper flight level. There can be some mistakes in explanations, we will fix those. But in the end, usually the difference is very little and can be ignored.
- Name: Delife
  Comment: @ATPLQ I might be wrong but in the explanation it says that 17 700 is the pressure altitude whereas PA is the height above 1013, in this case 18 000. 17 000 would be the height above QNH so just altitude, right ?

- Name: Tetouanmag
  Comment: Had this question in my exam. The question is more something like : (something like that, but #transit clearance# is the important idea in the question and removes other options).

Moreover, i think one of the alicante TWR option is 4000ft, not 5000.

  Comment: @olivercairns Overflying the airport is when you are not entering the control zone, and most likely staying in the TMA. Crossing is when you are flying in the control zone (closer to the airport).
- Name: olivercairns
  Comment: @Olie2 what is the difference between overflight and crossing?
- Name: Olie2
  Comment: You have to OVERFLY the CTR, not CROSS it.
Overflying is between FL75 and 4500 ft. 5000ft is appropriate.
If you want to CROSS it, 1500ft is maximum. 1000ft would be appropriate.

  Comment: Hello, got yesterday a similar question but with a huge trap. The he cruise leg was in NAM without any clue about it.
We had to convert it to NGM and then do the calculation as in the question. There was also a lot parts of the trip to add to get the final result.
The question was asking for time between destination and alternate.
I don't remember the figure but the different steps were misse approach, cruise leg (in NGM but not mentioned, just XXX NM" ), descent, holding expected, approach and landing.
In the answers, 2 answers were possible one using NGM, one using NAM.
As the question was worth 2 points, I figured they wanted NAM to NGM because I had a similar question worth 1 point with only one possible answer using NGM like here.

  Comment: @codfather You can not "rely" (as per theory) on EDSA airfield because it's a GRASS runway (green inside the blue circle), it could (AND WILL) blend with the terrain.
I've flown all my flight hours in the "country side" and quite often I found myself struggling to differentiate grass runways and fields.. I personally would have used the mast as it's high and easy to spot, or I'd have "diverted" up to the mast (3563') east of Besingen, north/west of EDSA.
- Name: codfather
  Comment: Why not the airfiled? Perfect location for turning and avoiding the restricted airspace, they ask which is a suitable point to start turning, not to fly towards. The way the question is built makes one thing that the aircraft departs straight from EDMC to EDTS and, somewhere along the way, we must find a suitable point to start a turn in order to avoid restricted airspace.

Then do the same from EDMC to the mast to EDTS.
The question states that we want to go in the most DIRECT manner. You can clearly see that from EDSA to EDTS you will still pass through the restricted area if you follow the most direct manner. If you go to the mast, you will avoid that area.

Are they saying, that we fly direct to the mast and then turn??

- Name: Cintra
  Comment: Correct me if im wrong, but from what I've learned:

IFR charts themselves are still oriented to TRUE north, rather airways, radials, etc., are in MAGNETIC.

In other words, when taking a bearing in reference to a meridian, you get true. When taking a bearing in reference to an airway or radial, you get magnetic.
- Name: Mariel
  Comment: Could you please explanation why the conversion is needed at all, since many students are already asking? Also, is "initial" referring to the chlong as it is in GNAV? The explanation is not that clear as it is.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello all! There seems to be some confusion around this question, and charts in general which I will try to address.
Latitude and Longitude are referenced to Geographic or True North. Whenever we measure the angle between two points on a chart relative to a line of longitude, we are measuring the True Direction. This is true for the gridlines on every aeronautical chart (unless referenced to "grid North" but this is now outside the scope of ATPL Theory).
Airways are usually provided as Magnetic Headings. Similarly, the rose placed around VORs on charts is aligned to Magnetic North. On this chart, there is no rose OR airway to or from either NAVAID from which we can measure the angle. The best reference we have is a line of longitude (008ºW), which points to True North. There is, conveniently, a closeby Isogonal which gives us a fairly accurate idea of the variation from where we are measuring the heading.
Due to convergence (covered in General Navigation), the True Heading will be different at Keflavik. The variation will also be different at Keflavik. We are asked to determine the Magnetic Heading at Benbecula, so measure it here on the chart, and use the local variation. We could also measure this at Keflavik using the chart in the exact same manner - measure the angle against a local line of longitude and then apply the variation at that point.
As such, the current explanation is correct and provides the quickest and most accurate way to approach this question using the knowledge you should learn from Flight Planning only. I hope this is helpful!

  Comment: @tomasao by using our plot on the chart, the number we get is automatically the true bearing. the matter you're referring to is the fact that that the heading given by the chart between two waypoints (not the one calculated by us) is magnetic.
- Name: Julez
  Comment: Chart states: Grid Bearing = True Bearing.
We want Magnetic Bearing.
-> CDMVT Rule (from T back to M)
West variation: from left to right "-" and opposite direction "+"
East variation: -> "+" and <- "-"
So we have to add the West variation.

Hope it helps.

  Comment: Saw exactly what @agusbin is describing in AUSTRO SPAIN. I cant find anything similar in the bank.
- Name: Muhammedkasem
  Comment: There is a clear contradiction between the two explanations regarding the calculation of additional fuel in CFS scenarios. The first question 338615 and its explanation state that only the smallest difference between CFS and OBF should be used, covering the nearest alternate only. However, this question requires the highest difference, covering all critical points. Unless the operational policy or the question specifically requires coverage of all critical scenarios, the correct application per EASA AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.181 is to use the minimum required for the closest suitable alternate. Please clarify and ensure consistency.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Muhammedkasem.
Question 338615: Smallest difference between CFS and OBF
In this case, the question presents two alternate airport scenarios, but you are only required to plan for reaching one alternate, not both. So, to determine additional fuel, you only need to ensure you can reach the closer alternate.
Therefore, the correct method here is to take the smallest difference between the Off-Block Fuel (OBF) and the Critical Fuel Scenario (CFS), because that represents the least extra fuel needed to safely reach the required alternate.
Question 338327: Largest difference from multiple critical points (ETPs)
This question is different in nature. It involves two critical points (ETPs) along the route. Each ETP is assessed independently in terms of whether, at that specific point, you would have enough fuel to safely divert, hold, and land.
In this case, the correct approach is to calculate the required additional fuel at each ETP and then take the largest difference. Why? Because you don’t know at which point the emergency may occur, and you need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.
I hope this makes sense!
- Name: Muhammedkasem
  Comment: There appears to be a clear contradiction in the way additional fuel is calculated between two q in the bank.
• In question 338615, the explanation specifically states that we should select the smallest difference between the Critical Fuel Scenario (CFS) and Off-Block Fuel (OBF), i.e., the minimum additional fuel required.
• However, in the question above, no such clarification is given, and the answer expects us to use the largest difference.

Both q ask about the “additional fuel requirement” based on the OBF and CFS, but the application is inconsistent. Could you please clarify which method is correct and ensure consistency across the database?

Thank you!

If you are flying over the ocean and you are approaching your last ETP before leaving the ETOPS area, you may need less fuel to reach your destination than the last alternate airport.

  Comment: @Luke6 you are great how do you know this thing
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @DPERD @Luke6 has explained it very well. In Q338615, there are 2 alternates and each one has 1 CFS. Since we are only required by law to reach one alternate, we only have to have enough fuel for one of the CFS. This is why in Q338615, you choose the smallest difference between CFS and OBF.
In Q338327, you only have 1 alternate aerodrome. Along this route, there are 2 CFS so you must have enough fuel for both CFS to ensure that you can make the alternate aerodrome safely. As such you must take the larger difference to cover for both CFS.
- Name: DPERD
  Comment: This sais the opposite than Q338615, please clarify.
- Name: Luke6
  Comment: Hi all, I tried to find the difference between the two similar questions in the bank and might've found something:

Q338615 - "2 Alternates & smallest difference

This question states that we have 2 alternates whereas the legal requirement is only 1.
This means that you can take the smallest value corresponding to the closest alternate aerodrome to your route based on the legal requirement (and possibly use that extra gain of mass for other reasons such as more passengers, bags, etc)

Q338327 - "2 Critical Points" & larger difference

This question is similar but has one major difference which is that we consider 2 CRITICAL points along our route for only 1 alternate aerodrome (as opposed to 2 in the previous question).
Critical points indicate how much fuel you would need in different scenarios if you were faced with an emergency scenario. Here we have 2 of these, thus if we were to face any of the two, we would prefer to face the worst-case scenario in which you would need the most fuel and take the largest difference between the 2 values.

That's how I see the way to resolve these 2 questions and hopefully, it helps!

  Comment: for this kind of questions, how can we be sure that we don't need to convert to NAM first? Thanks for your help! :-)
- Name: Cano2020
  Comment: it should be actual 15 kg, instead of 47, they are asking us for the new Fuel with 140 kt of TAS, so if we would fly with 130 kt we would still have a HWC of 25 kt, therefore our GS will be 105.

So 166NM / 105 kt = 1,58 h x 162 kg/h = 256 kg
166 NM / 115 = 1,44h x 188 = 271 kg
a increase of 15 kg
- Name: YounesSebbouba
  Comment: @Ranieri, more simple way for me :

Planned TAS : 130 kts
Planned HWC : -10kts
FF @ 130kts = 162 kg /h

--> Time = Distance / Speed

Planned TAS to Planned GS : 130 - 10 = 120

Time = 166 / 120 = 1.38 at this point no need to convert anything just continue working as :

FF = 162kg/h so fuel needed for 166 nm = 162 x 1.38 = 223.56

Now, we'll work the actual TAS and Forecast :

GS : 140 kts - 25 kts = 115
T = 166/115 = 1.44
FF @ 140 TAS = 188
188 x 1.44 = 270.72

Additional fuel required : 270.72 - 223.5 = 47.22 Kg
- Name: Ranieri
  Comment: forecast:
tas= 130kt-> ff= 162 kg/h -> 2,7 kg/ min
forecast wind= 10head wind -> gs= 130-10= 120kt
to cover 166nm with gs of 120 we need:
166nm/120kt= 1h 23min, which is equal to 80min. so forecast fuel is:
80x2.7= 224,1 kg

actual:
but the actual wind is different, so:
to compensate we fly at 140 tas
tas= 140kt-> ff= 188 kg/h -> 3,13 kg/min
with actual wind of 25 kt head wind.
tas-head wind=gs -> 140-25= 115 kt
to cover the same distance(166nm) at 115 kt we need:
166/115= 1h 26min which is equal to 86min
fo actual consume fuel is:
86x3,13= 269,18kg

we just find the difference btw the forecast consume fuel to actual consume fuel which is:

269,18-224,1= 45,08 kg more

therefore, we need to take the given MORA (16200) and subtract 2000', leaving us with 14,200'.

- Name: SlavovYani
  Comment: You should calculate temp deviation for AIR COLUMN, so we need to start with QNH not 1013 for ISA deviation. And the we get 17000 -390= 16610ft - 13500ft = 3110ft. This is AIR COLUMN for temperature calculations.
- Name: 777umaid
  Comment: 1- Remove the clearance from MIN GRID ALT as it AUTO applied So = 14200

Do not use clearance as well with FL 170

2- Get the Indicated .
ISA DEV = -10
3- Get the TRUE

True = 16485.6
Now clearance is TRUE - MIN GRID ALT = 2285.6 ft
- Name: Hossein123
  Comment: Just so you know when to add things and subtract after using the figure in the explanation:

P. Alt is using 1013. If we want to change it to an Indicated Alt. of 1000 hpa. Just think of what you would do in the plane, you turn the knob down from 1013 to 1000 and you can see the altitude indication dropping. So 1013-1000 = 13. 13 x 30 = 390. We subtract the P. Alt of 17'000ft by 390 to get an I. Alt of 16610.

Now for the temperature corrections, remember Cold Kills, because your P.Alt lies to you and says you are at 17000ft but in reality your True Altitude is lower, hence the cold kills bit. So if you are going from P.Alt to True Alt. you subtract your temp. correction to the P.Alt to get True Alt.

- Name: Faizan
  Comment: Not sure if this is correct way but it worked for me

TA= PA+30(QNH-1013)+(4/1000 x ISA DEV x column of air between airport elevation and ALT)

ISA Dev : -10 (15-(2x17) = -19 actual temp -29)
Column of air : 3500 (17000-13500)

Apply formula
17000+30(1000-1013)+(4/1000 x -10 x 35000) = 16500

Moca 16200 - 2000 feet clearance = 14200

16500-14200= 2300 ~ Ans 2286

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL). In this case, the airfield elevation is said to be 13 500 ft, and it must be taken into account for the temperature correction.
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

  Comment: Isnt the temperature correction applied for the air between aircraft and terrain?
If we are flying at F170 (minus the pressure correction = 16.610ft) and Grid MORA 16200 (with 2000ft obstacle clearance), it leaves us with: 16610 - 16200 = 410ft + 2000ft = 2410ft to apply ISA deviation to.

Why are you using station elevation? Or am I missing something?

  Comment: I know the order causes a lot of confusion but, for me, finding some logic in it helped. - We can only apply the temp. correction to the height between the AC and the reporting station. This is the most important rule. So we have to do the following: When the question wants the True Altitude: Apply Pressure correction first, Temp. correction second. When the question wants the Pressure Altitude / FL: Apply Temp. correction first, Pressure correction second. To Summarise: For TA: P first, T second. For PA: T first, P second.

  Comment: Minimum Grid Altitude (MGA)
MGA represents the lowest safe altitude which can be flown off-track.
The MGA is calculated by rounding up the elevation of the highest obstruction within the respective grid area to the next 100ft and adding an increment of
1000ft for terrain or obstructions up to 6000ft or
2000ft for terrain or obstructions above 6000ft.
e.g. 6345ft obstacle = 6400ft rounded up + 2000ft buffer = 8400ft MGA Shown in hundreds of feet. Lowest indicated MGA is 2000ft.
This value is also provided for terrain and obstacles that would result in an MGA below 2000ft. Exception is over water areas where the MGA can be omitted.
- Name: peko
  Comment: @ATPLQ
You didn't apply the pressure correction first in your explanation that is why the result is different.

Indicated altitude 17000 , pressure difference =13HPA x 30 ft = 390 ft
Altitude corrected for pressure difference = 16610 ft
Height of the parcel of air for the temperature correction = 16610-13500=3110 ft
Isa deviation -10 degrees
Temperature correction =0.04 x 3110=124 ft
True altitude= 16610-124ft=16486 ft
Grid area altitude provides 2000ft of clearance so the highest obstacle is at 16200-2000=14200 ft
Clearance = True altitude-highest possible obstacle= 16486 - 14200 = 2286 ft

When calculating the TRUE altitude with the indicated altitude given (FL), apply the pressure correction first then the temperature correction to the height of the parcel of air adjusted for the pressure deviation.
When calculating the indicated altitude and knowing the true altitude (clearance or obstacle) , the order in which the corrections are made does not matter .
In the CAA there are type in questions so you need to be precise with your answer.
- Name: ATRpilot
  Comment: Why EASA can't provide the mathematically correct answer is beyond me. Going through your calculation only to be left with an answer which doesn't match any of the options is a dirty move and leaves students doubting themselves and, in some instances, going back and changing what was a perfectly good method. This obtuse 'closest answer' BS should be stopped as it needlessly costs us time and points..

  Comment: Can someone explain which order we do calculations in. Some questions apply temperature correction first, some apply pressure correction first. Thank you.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Marcus, to get true altitude first apply pressure correction then temperature correction. This is the correct order or the reverse when we are trying to determine a proper flight level. But in the end, the difference is very little even if the correct order is not used rarely leads to a mistake. Order is corrected.

- Name: Daniel
  Comment: I already have a problem. somebody explain in human terms when he subtracts and when he adds, for example, the W or E declension
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Daniel if you are referring to the variation, here's the explanation : 
To get the true heading, you need to first read the magnetic compass, then either add an Easterly, or subtract a Westerly, magnetic variation; based on the isogonic lines.
When converting true to magnetic heading, you’d do the opposite and subtract an Easterly, or add a Westerly, magnetic variation. This is where the saying East is least, West is best stems from.
Hope it helps!
- Name: Figo
  Comment: @Daniel, the magnetic track from GASKO to OBOXA is 150, but the question asks for reciprocal track OBOXA to GASKO, which is 150 + 180 = 330 magnetic track. We’re asked for the true track, which is 328 because right next to Gasko you can read a variation of 2W. Magnetic Track 330 equals true track 328.

Hope this helps.

  Comment: why plus 180?

  Comment: easy question,if you see 150 near Gasko,150 plus 180 is equal 330 minus 2W is on left of Gasko ... 328

  Comment: Overlay:
Follows the same path as a conventional procedure, but flown using GPS/RNAV instead of ground-based navaids.

Bypass:
A new GPS route that avoids or replaces the old conventional path for better efficiency.

Overlay = same path, new tech
Bypass = new path, new route

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @ilsenatore92. The published NAVAIDs for the procedure must be operational and you must monitor the navigation information from them. RNAV overlay procedures allow you to use RNAV system to navigate along SIDs (and STARs) which are otherwise defined by ground-based NAVAIDs. I hope this answers your question!

- Name: Timothy
  Comment: @Babgon94 How could 1a) ever be lower than 2)?
- Name: Babgon94
  Comment: For the minimum fuel for reciprocating engines in isolated aerodromes you compare:

The *greater* of 1) and 2):
. . 1) The lesser of a) and b):
. . . . .a) 45min + 15% Time in Cruise, or
. . . . .b) 2 H time in cruise
. . 2) Fuel to fly 45 min

So for example, in this question:

The *greater* of 1) and 2) is 820 kg, since:
. . 1) The lesser of a) and b) is approx. 820 kg, since:
. . . . .a) (45min + 15% Time in Cruise) x 780 kg/h = 819 kg (approx. 820 kg)
. . . . .b) 2 H time in cruise x 780 kg/h = 1560 kg
. . 2) Fuel to fly 45 min x 780 kg/h = 585 kg (approx. 590 kg)

  Comment: **Final Reserve Fuel is included in PDP Fuel.**
**CONT Fuel may be used up inflight and not required when overhead DEST**
..
For reciprocating engine, PDP fuel is the LOWER of:
1) 45 min + 15% CRZ: 45 min + (2hr x 15%) = 63 min
2) 2 hr: 120 min

Therefore, PDP Fuel = 63min x 780kg/hr = 819kg

  Comment: @Jake201002 The additional fuel for isolated aerodromes INCLUDES the final reserve fuel
- Name: Jake201002
  Comment: The additional fuel of 819 makes sense. However you should surely be overhead with that and your final reserve, which in this case would be 45 minutes worth of fuel consumption as its a reciprocating engine. So should it not be 819 (additional) + 585 (Final reserve) to give 1404?

  Comment: UK CAA, 1/4/2021

asked for contingency and stated "to find holding fuel flow you can use final reserve."

I multiplied the final reserve fuel by 2 to get the holding fuel flow, because FR= 30 mins of holding for jet which also means half of the holding fuel flow is the final reserve fuel.

then I did 5% of trip fuel and 5 mins of holding ff and found that the 5% is the bigger number so I went for it, was around 242.
type in btw.

goodluck.

From personal experience, unless the question text specifically states "En-route Alternate/ERA" available, this should not be assumed and a contingency of 5% shall be used. Hope this helps!

  Comment: 37.5 / 250 * 60 = 9
- Name: DrPilot
  Comment: Basic speed formula.
Velocity = Distance : Time

250kt (as written in up-right corner box) = 37.5NM (17nm molix-lutex + 13nm lutex-robvi + 7.5nm robvi-sugol) : TIME
37.5NM : 250KT = 9 minutes

If it is displayed as 0.15 in your calculations, just hit the "degrees/hours-minutes-seconds" (usually circla and 3 commas) button and it will give you 0h9min0sec.

simply - align the 60 min/h mark with 250 kt, then scroll to the calculated 37.5 NM.

  Comment: UK CAA (Remember to come back and mark as seen after your exams). @atpl fuel actual at Dep was 3000. Estimated at 2400. Actual at B 2300. ATO at B 12:10. Distance for B 300. Distance for A 150.
- Name: Nou
  Comment: Work with the actual numbers.

Actual time between Departure and point B is= 12'14'-11'40'=0'34'. So, the time between departure and point B is 34 minutes.

The distance at point be is 150NM, meaning you covered this distance in 34 minutes, so get the Ground Speed. GS= 150/34 minutes= 264.70 Ground Speed.

The distance at point C is 300 NM. Since we are using the same conditions, we will use our Ground Speed to get how long we will be able to cover this distance. To get the time we will 300/264.70= 1 Hour and 8 Minutes. Add this time to the Actual time at point B ( which is given in the table) = 1'8'+12'14'= 13'22'

To calculate the Fuel flow, simply get the difference between the Departure and fuel remaining at point B= 2800- 2290 = 510 was burned, and since we already calculated that the time to cover between the departure and point B is 34 minutes, so we will get how much fuel we burn per minute by 510/34=15 lbs per minute.

We have also got that at point C we will cover this distance at 1 Hour and 8 minutes or 68 minutes, so to get how much fuel we will burn at point C we will 15*68=1020 lb will be burned. Subtract 1020 from the Actual fuel remaining at point B 2290-1020= 1270 lb fuel remaining.

  Comment: Misleading question. Have to remember Estimated values are updated throughout the flight when you get new 'real life' data.

Using actual values can see that 150 miles was travelled in 34 minutes => speed = 265 kts

300 miles (leg distance not accumulated distance :/) will take 68 minutes.

1214 + 68 minutes = 1322

Fuel flow = 900 lbs per hour

900/60 x 68 = 1020 lbs

2290 - 1020 = 1270 lbs remaining

- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: appeal. the annex says clearly . before reaching or at NE SE SW. so i can accept the supposition that the pilot will not get through SE since he comes from SW and then wants to go S, but the answer then should be AT SW, not before arriving at SW. because like this you are saying that the pilot is not allowed to contact frequency when AT SW, which is not true.

  Comment: Same question today in Latvia CAA just it was more clear because they noted that aircraft was approaching near the coast from south west.
- Name: piperguy66
  Comment: Guys I think the real answer lies in the Route Description ..
it states " South Route REP SW - S " and NOT SE (basically SE is not a reporting point according to the chart ) ..
REP stands for Report

Silly question
- Name: Murat
  Comment: None of the answers states "at or before", so by just looking at the chart, you can see that contacting ATC AT SE would be to late, you would enter ATZ without getting clearance in time.
- Name: FREEOFATPLSHACKLES
  Comment: I'll trust ATPLQ's answer but this question is bad. If you approach from South you can be near the coast either at point SW or SE both are near the coast, the question needs to specify which portion of the coast we're on. Would 200% appeal this .

I'm sick of this crap from Easa. It's absolute no bearing on real life ops. Remember it and move on sadly. 2 correct answers and its' solely down to your interpretation on the day along with what kind of mood the person who sets the question is in.
- Name: Jakub
  Comment: Why DAN has so many thumbs up? It's clearly written in 19-3 in arrivals ".. shall establish radio contact with Alicante twr AT or BEFORE reaching VFR REPs..". And again EASA.... the more correct answer to "near the coast" is SW because it's closer to coast than SE.
- Name: Loris
  Comment: @atplquestions why "prior entering atz" is wrong? in the aerodrome information chart is written explicitly that aircrafts should contact the arc before arriving at REPs

Question Number: AT00094
- Name: Muhammedkasem
  Comment: Guys, just a heads-up: since the question clearly states that its not possible to land back at the departure aerodrome due to weather conditions, having a take-off alternate is mandatory ( option A). Also, you always need to have a destination alternate (option C). So, in this case, option A is definitely the correct choice, I compared these 2 options
- Name: Michiels177
  Comment: the correct answer was literally the first option I disregarded -.-
- Name: RotorBoat
  Comment: so, the take-off alternate is an alternate you can fly to after T/O should the need arise
if im understanding the question right, it states that the "take-off alternate" is the destination aerodrome?

man that melted my brain. what a load of shakespeare just to say you're flying to your destination airport lmao

- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: @SkrrrrtPapa in my country you can appeal the question if, in your opinion there s something wrong with it. from a wrong answer, to a poor wording issue that leads to misleading questions or even if the results are too close together and dont take into account for approximations. The fact that you dont know if the question is valid or not wont make a difference. if it was valid, your appeal is negated. in the other hand, if they see you have a point, they might set your question as correct. in my last exam i appealed 4 questions and for 3 of them i was right. this increased my score from 86% to 91%. so i always suggest to appeal questions whenever they are doubtful. remember that it is your right to go against poorly made exam questions. and EASA exams are FULL of appealable questions. these are my 2cents obv. so you feel free to follow up or not. (also this question in particular appeared written differently from how it is here. that s why it s important also to know when to appeal if you know how the question should be written)
- Name: GhaithGarraoui
  Comment: The only case you can avoid the need for additional fuel is if your destination is closer than any other suitable aerodrome and is within the regulatory take off alternate distance (1 hour cruise time at the OEI or ETOPS diversion time).
- Name: SkrrrrtPapa
  Comment: @Typhoon you say appeal to many questions. How do you know if it was wrong on the exam? You dont get feedback on questions. Appeal to what?
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: appeal for terrible wording. plus it has conflicting feedback based on authority.
if it was written better i would agree on needing a take off alternate. but it is hard to depct the situation with such a poor wording

  Comment: What if A is Heathrow and B is Sydney? I aint putting Heathrow as my alternate.. the route distance matters.
- Name: GhaithGarraoui
  Comment: What "need for additional fuel" is avoided when your T/O alternate is your destination? Is this only valid when your destination AD is within one hour at the OEI and is the nearest available AD? Because if it's further than another available AD, you need to choose that available AD without the need for additional fuel. I mean, usually, there is no need for additional fuel for a T/O alternate, right?

  Comment: check question 333572

There you say that if headwind increases, the FMS will compensate by increasing speed.
Here you say the ETA will fall behind. Why does it fall behind, why is it not maintained?

Any inputs?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @PaulVlad, thank you for your comment. These two questions indeed seem contradictory, but the problem is not in this question but in question 333572. On question 333572 we received comments similar to the one you also stated. Our response to the comments on that question is as follows:
"As a Boeing 737 pilot myself, I must admit that I have some reservations about the currently accepted correct option. However, it has been reported by students that this answer was deemed correct in their exams. In such cases, I would encourage you to challenge this question if you encounter it in your own examinations.
Now, let's discuss the behavior of the Flight Management System (FMS) when there is a variance between the actual wind and the wind entered into the FMS:
If the FMS detects a difference in wind, it will calculate a new optimal speed based on the updated wind data and the entered cost index. However, this adjustment is applicable only when the VNAV mode is set to ECON. If a fixed speed is selected, the FMS will continue flying at that speed regardless of the wind conditions. In such cases, the FMS will continuously recalculate the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) based on the current time, position, actual wind for the current leg, and inserted winds for other legs.
Most FMS systems provide a feature that allows pilots to reach a specific waypoint at a predetermined ETA. When this mode is activated, the FMS will continuously recalculate and adjust the speed to achieve the desired ETA at the specified waypoint. It's worth noting that this mode is not a standard operating mode."

Question Number: AT00100
- Name: Matti
  Comment: BGS has exactly the same question and set of answers - word by word. But the correct answer is "There will be no effect as the FMC will make an automatic correction". Who to believe? Throw a coin and pray..
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Matti... interesting! The FMC uses the cruise altitude to compute optimum speeds (e.g., ECON speed), fuel flow estimates, estimated time of arrival (ETA), step climbs or descents. Therefore, if the cruise level is entered incorrectly, these calculations will be based on wrong assumption. We believe our current correct answer is the correct one. If anyone comes across this question in their exam, please let us know. Thank you!
- Name: Giordan886
  Comment: you have to assume that you're still on the ground doing planning and briefing, in flight if you select on MCP a lower FL then the FMC will adjust time and fuel flow based on the current data.
- Name: Pietro
  Comment: Enac today, watch out bupecause there was a lot of poor structured questions that didint have correct answer including this, in the exam there wasnt a correct answer like here unfortunately
- Name: FlyingLegend
  Comment: You are all right, the FMC will compute the right values for the entered altitude or flight level, BUT let's say you plan with FL350, but accidently type FL360 in the FMC and don't recognise the wrong level. So before the flight the FMC will calculate values that are wrong for you, but right for the level you typed in, inflight the FMC would then correct the values according to the actual flight level.
Take for example a fuel calculation from FPL: Let's say you have a trip fuel of 6450kg and want to calculate the 5% contigency, but you type in 6540kg instead. Your calculation is still correct, but the result is not.
The question is a bit tricky to understand
- Name: ricardgalisteo
  Comment: A computer is never wrong, it does whatever it is told to. If you ask FL400, you will get FL400, even if you wanted to put FL300. This question is bs like almost all the bank of this subject made buy a bunch of chimpanzees and failed careers that can't even use commas or comprehend basic language.
People say meteo is ambiguous, but it was not half bad as this subject is. At least half the questions are made by professional meteorologists, not like this clown subject.

  Comment: ULC POLAND 6.04 slightly reworded, but correct answer similar to one in
- Name: Pipinho
  Comment: This aint true. The wording is terrible. If the planned flight level should be FL350 and the pilot instead inserts FL370 it will give the wright values for the FL370 however it wont give you the values you where expecting on flight planning however the calculations it does for the FL370 are still coprrect.
- Name: Malgorzata
  Comment: I can confirm that answer A is correct in polish CAA -ULC
- Name: Oleksandr
  Comment: Depends on phase. FMC will 100% sure make a correction, but only in flight. On FLIGHT PLANNING phase -> speed/fuel/time calculation will be according to the inserted FL. Most probably, EASA assumed the answer should be respectful to the name of the subject))

faultybird: It' jusEASAfied, it's only by just 10ft.
- Name: mariokart
  Comment: I have another way.

1) 1030-1013 = 17 x 30 = 510ft
2) 3500 elev. - 510 = 2990 ft (because we're going from qnh to qne)
3) 25.000 - 2990 = 22010 ft

closest answer 22000
- Name: omer
  Comment: TA = PA + 30 (QNH-1013)
TA = 25000 + 30 (1030-1013) = 25510
clearance = TA - elevation = 25510 - 3500 = 22010

closest answer 22000

- Name: DannyTheRaccoon
  Comment: Agree with Arrow! Without the question saying at which point we are cleared to FL330 from 6000ft, there is NO WAY you can possibly find a definitive answer instead of just guessing like you did. If anything, you should consider the whole SID procedure up to ANDIK to be flown at 6000ft, and the climb to FL330 to only start from there (without additional information, this is surely what the question sounded to me!)

The question states we will only use 8/15mins of Additional Fuel, so no need for an emergency as we have enough. If it is worth 3 points, it's a steal and make sure you all know this question by heart. Usually 3 points are given for Extra Fuel calculations etc.

  Comment: Fuel rules have to be changed in order to consider that tankering has anything to do with weather below minimuns at destination. The question is a wrong joke.
- Name: JamesRayner
  Comment: The reason for 2 being correct is that you don't mind having extra fuel in the event of a diversion.

Since the weather is below minima, you may need to go to your alternate. In that case, it would actually be nice to have the extra fuel

Number 4 is probably quite obvious so no explanation needed there

Good luck guys :)

  Comment: @DRU1024 If you load your extra fuel without taking into account the contingency burn, the fuel you loaded will potentially not meet the requirements of the minimum block fuel for the EIDW-LFPG leg (7100kg) as the contingency burn could've been used, and will end up not being accounted for.

It's a very awful assumption for a question like this, unfortunately. If you assume worst-case fuel burn for this scenario, it should help you push through this question!

  Comment: (1) tof at lfpg minus taxi,trip,contmin
5226-230-2933-157 = 1906kg of fuel in your tanks when you land at eidw

(2) you need to take off with 7100 at eidw so:
7100-1906 = 5194 kg EXTRA that you need to add when you take off at lfpg

(3) also fuel penalty is 60kg more fuel per 1000 extra
(5194/1000)*60 = 312kg

(4) add fuel penalty
5194+312 = 5506 kg total extra fuel

- Name: Schlugoo
  Comment: I had a question like this but nothing to calculate. Just theory. Austro Control 30.08.24

You plan a flight from Athen to Paris and back. Due to refueling problems in Paris, you decide to take fuel for the flight Paris-Athen on the outbound leg, so that no fueling is necessary in Paris.

What do you expect?
A.) The fuel consumption will be less from Paris to Athen
B.) The take off mass Paris - Athens increases
C.) The CO2 emission will increase on the outbound leg Athen-Paris
D.) You expect no change

I chose option C.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Schlugoo. We have added a new question based on the information you've shared: 337896. Thank you for your feedback.
- Name: Nmaca64
  Comment: How I did it:
We need to be at the gate in Dublin with 7100 kg. So what do we need in Paris to achieve that? That and everything we reasonably expect to burn: definitely taxi and trip, and contingency. So we need 7100+230+2933+157 = 10420kg at the stand in Paris. We have planned 5226kg, so that means we want to tanker 10420 - 5226 = 5194 kg.
THEN don't miss the extra step of fuel penalty for tankering! We need to add 60 kg per 1000 kg extra, which brings you to 5505.4 kg
- Name: ViktorS
  Comment: KermitTheSnitch

Before solving this question, take a sip of coffee and relax, cause its quite simple, once you get it ;-)

1) Knowing that our planned fuel in the first leg is 5226 kg, we subtract taxi, trip and contingency = 1906 kg (fuel after landing at EIDW).
2) Our fuel needed for the return is 7100 kg --> 7100 - 1906 = 5194.
3) The fuel penalty is 60 kg per 1000 kg. Just divide 5194 with 1000, and multiply the answer with 60, which is 311.64.

Add 5194 and 311.64 together and you will get 5505.64! :-D
It just requires some patience and practice, and you will get there.
Good luck!

- Name: Talisa
  Comment: Hi there,
I am not convinced on the correct answer and the explanation. The explanation assumes the worst case on the flight LFPG-EIDW by fully consuming the contingency. Would the worst case not that we also assume an additional holding at EIDW and end up at EIDW with a remaining final reserve fuel only? With this assumption we would remain with 914 kg on board only at EIDW and a need of 7100 kg for the EIDW-LFPG leg. This would bring us to additional 6186kg required + penalty (672kg) = +7458Kg.

We will add this question to our database but we need more details about it. We don't want to randomly change other fuel quantities to add a new question with the answer 2972 kg, because this new question would not be the same as the one you all encountered anyway, only the answers would be the same.

- Name: Nivatierrez
  Comment: Same as Aurel in Spain, another numbers and the correct answer is 2972
- Name: Pepperoni69
  Comment: I solved it this way:

1) determine the fuel that is gonna be burned btw LFPG-EIDW. We need to take into account the contingency because, in case we don't assume is used and, for some reason we need it, we are below the minimum fuel for the return flight.
The total fuel that we are gonna burn on the first leg so is 230+2933+157=3320kg.
2) for the return leg, EIDW-LFPG we need 7100kg, as stated by the flight plan, but we'll have in our tanks also the fuel we didn't burn for the first leg (5226-3320=1906kg), so actually we don't need to take with us 7100kg for the return leg because we are gonna have also the 1906kg we didn't burn for the leg LFPG-EIDW.
3) Considering the above, the fuel we need to additionally put in our tanks is the difference btw the fuel required from EIDW-LFPG and the fuel we are not gonna burn on the leg LFPG-EIDW, so 7100-1906= 5194kg
4) to this 5194kg we need to add the fuel penalty to carry them, we are gonna take the penalty of the first leg as we need to carry them from LFPG to Eidw. As a result we have [(5194/1000) x 60] + 5194 = 5506.

hope it helps guys!

We need for T/O from B to C 7100 kg (target fuel).. Then, Target fuel - Landing fuel = 5194 kg, BUUUT we need to add the fuel penalty! adding the 69 kg per 1000 kg, 5194 + 358 = 5552 kg (close enough)

  Comment: new question

New question for flight planning seen 07/11/2023 for Austro control in Spain.

An aircraft is flying along a true course of 276 and the actual wind is different than the forecast wind. The forecast wind is 240/15 and the actual wind is 290/25. The airspeed remains the same. Which statements are correct or incorrect?

1) The lower ground speed will result in a later time of arrival.
2) The wind correction angle will change from a value to the right to a value to the left.

Answer was 1) Correct and 2) Incorrect

Worded alongs the lines of this

  Comment: Seen Austro Spain 7/11/23 , although different values for fuel and answer was 2972kg, if I remember correctly. I can confirm that they want you to assume you have used your contingency fuel. The working out is exactly how the explanation is but just different numbers so make sure you know how to work it out, 2 pointer
- Name: easadepression
  Comment: In my opinion the contingency fuel burn in the explanation is irrelevant and has no reasons to be done. Is A T P L q making explanations to match the answer..?

Don't do the part with contingency and the answer will be 5339,2 which is the closest to the right one.
- Name: pierinocolombo
  Comment: First, to solve this question you have to stop complaining, now, taking the most important step, we begin to solve:

1) Knowing that our planned fuel in the first leg is 5226 kg, we subtract taxi, trip and contingency = 1906 kg (fuel after landing at EIDW).

2) Our fuel needed for the return is 7100 kg --> 7100 - 1906 = 5194.

3) The fuel penalty is 60 kg per 1000 kg, or in simpler numbers --> 6 kg per 100 kg. 5194 x 1.06 = 5505.4

I hope that helps :)
- Name: sidalmukhtar
  Comment: It is easy but the explanation is a way too complicated

You will land with 1906 KG after burning taxi trip and contingency so you need to fill 5194 to meet the required fuel for the return and since there is penalty on refueling which 60 kelo for each 1000 kg 5194*1.06= 5505.64 kg

  Comment: general feedback for everybody with Austro Control:

Unfortunately FPL was not banky at all. However it is still easy to pass as long as you are well prepared.
Out of 42 questions I knew 6 or 7 from and some of them have not been reported at Austro before.

The exam itself was very similar to GNAV.
More than half of all question were Flight/Aviation Computer questions -->finding W/V with heading given; find revised ground speed; find new ETAs with changed wind and so on.

About 80% of all questions were calculations - only very little theory.

Advise for Austro:
-make sure you are confident using the Flight Computer
-practice flight log questions
-take a look at the recently reported questions the morning before the exam just for short term memory.

Good luck !
- Name: ChrisScholl
  Comment: Okay, so after working through this question again and again, I came to a conclusion which should help (at least me) to solve this question..
1. they are asking us to have the target fuel (7100 kgs) on board when returning, so this is the amount of fuel we should have when arriving at EIDW
2. We intend to land at EIDW (if we would have to use the alternate we wouldn't care about the tankering anymore, so consider the reserve & alternate fuel untouched @EIDW). To get to EIDW we burn from our block fuel the taxi fuel, the trip fuel and we also consider having burnt the contingency fuel to be on the safe side if we really would need to use it.
3. So we arrive with 1906 kgs on board
4. Find the difference to target fuel to find out how much fuel we need to tanker to get our target fuel @EIDW and correct it for the increased fuel burn via the 60kgs/1000kgs at LFPG

I know for some this question might seem easy but i struggled a lot, maybe it helped someone else, too
Good Luck @ the exam :)

  Comment: SENASA SPAIN, answer 5506
- Name: Balkanpilot
  Comment: Why are we taking into account Extra fuel at EIDW? The question clearly states MINIMUM fuel. If I am the pilot on that flight I would've fuelled up 4265 kg of fuel (without 1014 kg of extra fuel). If that Extra fuel is necessary for any reason it should be stated in the question otherwise it is not needed in my opinion since we have enough final reserve fuel and alternate fuel.
- Name: Javier
  Comment: When you land at EIDW you need to read 7100kg on the fuel indicator.

1- So, you departed from LFPG with 5226kg but you will burn the taxi and trip fuel (2933+230=3163kg), so substract to know what you have remaining, 5226-3163=2063kg.

2- You have 2063kg remaining but you wanted 7100kg so substract to know the extra fuel you need to add before departing, 7100-2063=5037kg. Thats it, you have the extra fuel you need, now just calculate the fuel penalty and add it.

3- (5037/1000)x60=302.
302+5037= 5339
- Name: Levente
  Comment: Now I get it, but I used another method. Focus on that we need to have 7100 kg when departing from eidw. In order to achieve this, we need to depart from lfpg with the target fuel of 5226 (lfpg-eidw) and some extra (we need to find this). The key is that of this 5226 we won't consume the reserves, we'll have those at eidw.
Let's check our actual fuel in tanks after landing at eidw (basically the reserves of lfpg-eidw route): 157+992+914=2063, we already have this, but we need 7100, so we need 5037 kg more. But don't forget, that taxiing after landing at eidw requires 173 kg (this is very speculative, based on that we need 173 kg of taxi fuel when departing from eidw), we need to add this to extra (otherwise we wouldn't have 7100 when departing). 5037+173=5210 kg is the extra fuel.
Looking at the fuel plan we see that on the lfpg-eidw route there's a penalty if you carry extra fuel (+60 kg for every +1000kg). Calculate the penalty: extra/1000*60= 5210/1000*60=313 kg is our penalty. As last step for total extra, add extra fuel and penalty: 5210+313=5523 kg. How they get 5506, I don't know, but that's the closest value in the answers. If you find it difficult, try to draw 2 fuel tanks for the two different airports, and depict the required amounts at each locations.
- Name: Levente
  Comment: I think 5339 should be correct, in other questions we never account for taxi fuel at the destination airport
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Levente, remember that LFPG-EIDW-LFPG trip is made at this question. Therefore taxi fuel at EIDW should be taken into account as it is not the final destination.
- Name: Avigator
  Comment: How much fuel i have on me right now= 5226 kg (block)
How much fuel i need at destination to come back without refuelling= 7100 kg (block)
How much extra needed=7100 kg - 5226 kg= 1874 kg

But
How much i will burn during taxi and trip to destination= taxi(230 kg) + trip(2933 kg)= 3163 kg

If i fill my tank with 1874 kg + 3163 kg= 5037 kg + 302 kg (penalty 60kg/1000kg)= 5339 kg on top of what i have right now
i will left with 7100 kg of block fuel at destination to come back without refuelling.

Basically i need to fill my tanks with 5226 kg + 5339 kg= 10,565 kg to make sure i have 7100 kg of block fuel at destination.

In my opinion i only need 5339 kg minimum extra.

Any corrections will be appreciated?

- Name: RotorBoat
  Comment: @dlatr assuming the new syllabus, i believe if it states "with variation" in the q it'll mean to use the 3% for your leg to your optional refuelling destination.

if it states without variation, then you assume 5%

also if it states suitable en-route alternate or en-route alternate, you use 3%

Alternate is given here but in question we do not have anything that C is our alternate so alternate been calculated and given.

The reason why this procedure is named REDUCED contingency is because you DONT TAKE YOUR 5 percent of your TRIP fuel. BUT only from the Decision Point to your destination.

- Name: zeymahse
  Comment: @Soran04 Yes, as far as I've undestood, so far. If it's written on the chart, it's magnetic track and if you need true track, you can use CDMVT to add/subtract Var to get your true track, but, if you use your plotter on the chart, you'll directly read the true track and in this case you'll use the variation only if you need magnetic track.
Here, for example, since there isn't any written route that connects the two points that are mentioned, I draw a line myself to connect them. Using the plotter I got 82° TRUE track. Var is 2°W so -2° (because West is negative and East is positive for Var) and with CDMVT ( you subtract the values when going from right to left and you add them when going from left to right) I got 82° - (-2°) so 82° + 2° = 84° MAGNETIC Track
I did not seach for the distance sinnce there is only one 84° option.

  Comment: calculators headwind formula (cos) , doesn't give good results when there is heavy crosswind like 80-90 degrees from the side. that's what I realized now.

Flight computer gives the correct one.
- Name: liquid7
  Comment: easy solution to this without Flight Computer:
the only thing thats changed is a 5° decrease in OAT.
if you compare the planned TAS for A-B to B-C youll see that a 5 degree difference meant 2 kts slower TAS.
so just subtract 2 kts from the planned GS for B-C all youll be fine.

  Comment: TAS is 174 on the CRP5 when corrected for temperature. So thats only 1kt from the one given in the FPL.
Next look at the flight plan and see that TAS - GS gives a 18 kt HWC.
174-18 = 156 .. close enough to the 155 given.
There is not mucht point to use the wind side of the CRP5 to get the GS now.
- Name: KowalFly
  Comment: On CRP5:
1. Calculate the TAS for 155 CAS at FL100 with M25. The result is approximately 172 TAS.
2. Apply the wind (165/55) on the wind side. This gives a 19° right drift and a GS of 171 kt.
3. Balance the solution so that the true heading, after balancing, is 226°. (Rotate 19° so the rotation matches the indicated drift under the wind mark.)
4. Read the GS under the wind mark, which is approximately 154 kt.
- Name: Anezka
  Comment: Could I kindly ask you to review my calculation as I cannot find out where am I making a mistake? When I use the CRP-5 to get GS, I get a result close enough to the correct answer. But in Flight Planning I prefer to use trigonometry functions for majority of questions as I find it more accurate. This is the only Q which gives me a wrong answer with trigonometry, so I cannot get my head around it. Thank you!

W/V at FL100 = 165/55
T = -25°
CAS = 155 kt
TR (T°) = 245°
Using CRP-5 to convert CAS to TAS => TAS = 174 kt (its a bit closer to 174 than 173).
hwc = 55 x cos(80°) = 9.55 kt
gs = tas - hwc = 174 - 9.55 = 164.45 kt
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Anezka, thank you for your comment. The reason why you cannot reach the correct answer is that you have not included the effect of the crosswind on the ground speed in your calculations.
If the crosswind speed is not excessively high relative to your TAS, you get results very close to the correct answer. Otherwise, even if there is only a crosswind, your ground speed will be slightly lower than your TAS.
Simply, in the case of no wind, the thrust of the aircraft is parallel to the course as no WCA is required. So 100% of the thrust is directed to the forward direction. So TAS and GS become equal. However, in the case of a WCA to the right or left, there is a difference between the direction of the aircraft's thrust and the course. In this case, the aircraft cannot provide 100% thrust on the required course.
Therefore, when calculating the ground speed, it is also necessary to calculate the effect of the crosswind by multiplying TAS by the cosine of WCA. So;
Effective TAS = TAS x cosine of WCA = 173 kt x cos (18°) = 164.5 kt
Ground Speed = Effective TAS - Headwind component = 164.5 - 9.5 = 155 kt

  Comment: Guys dont even do this on the crp5. The only thing that changed from the original flight plan is the TAS from 175 to 173 . Wind is exaclty the same.So the original GS was 157 fibd the CLOSEST answer possible. THATS IT !!

  Comment: Pls check my last comment and try it out, something is wrong here
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Leonardo. There is nothing wrong with this question, please follow step by step what is mentioned in the explanation to get the solution. The use of a flight computer is a bit different since the input in the two questions you mentioned are different. Remember the following;
When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre.
When the Heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre.
Let's go back to this question. With the expected delay given in the question, only the temperature value changed from -20 degrees to -25 degrees. As a result of the change in temperature, TAS is affected and becomes 173 kt. Subject to exactly the same wind the TAS is subjected to a headwind component of about 18 kt, as in the first situation, and the new GS becomes 155 kt. In this way, this question can be solved by finding only the TAS value from the flight computer. Consequently, the marked answer to this question is correct. Thank you for your comment.
- Name: Leonardo
  Comment: I definitely get 163 with formula..

However if I use CRP-5 wind down method I get 155 but only after correcting for drift which is not the method I was taught to calculate GS as demonstrated in question 332284

I can only conclude the answer is wrong. I believe whoever wrote the question used the wrong TCourse. Instead of using 245 from B to C they used TCourse 95 from A to B which gives you 155kts ground speed using formula.

Thoughts?
- Name: Leonardo
  Comment: Btw if you actually do the calculations for the data given in the annex they are wrong, hw should be around 10 kts, they just want you to see that you can understand that if condition stay the same so there is no big change
- Name: Kangaxx
  Comment: This question's annex seems wrong.
Pre-flight planning indicates winds of 165°55kt (as given in the forecast and current plan) and GS of 157 is given. New-planning makes us use winds of 165°55kt (as given in the second forecast) which is the same. So ground speed should not change. The only exaplanation to have 155 as a correct answer is that the current plan given in the annex was wrong from the start.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Kangaxx. TAS depends on altitude and temperature values. In this question, even if the wind direction and velocity are the same in both flight time intervals at the relevant level, TAS will change due to the temperature difference and consequently GS will also change.
In the winds and temperature aloft forecast validity 0601 UTC to 0900 UTC table, the temperature shown in row B to C and column FL100 should be M20, not M25. We will update this as soon as possible. Thank you for your comment.

  Comment: Take planned HW so planned TAS 175 - Planned GS 157 = 18kt planned HWC
Correct TAS for temperature (-25*C) = 173kt (CRP5)
Apply planned HW to corrected TAS = New TAS 173kt - 18kt = 155kt GS
- Name: MarkoM
  Comment: CR3 after temperature correction TAS = 173 follow page 39. of the CR3 booklet accounting for EFFECTIVE TAS

1) TAS=173, TC 245, HWC= almost 10kt, XWC=almost 55kt
2) use outer scale to determine CRAB angle for XWC=55 it is equal to 19 deg.
3) use effective black scale from the middle ring and read effective speed from 19 deg. on outer scale which equals 164 kt TAS
4) finally account for the HWC=10kt to obtain final GS, 164 - 10 = 154 kt

  Comment: Hello, how it possible that dooing it with CR3, i get a headwind of 10kts? could you explain it (at least onece) cause i thin the people using CR3 hace the same right ( like the others) to know how to do it (we are paying the same (as others), and if you think the only approbed method to get the results is using CPR5, also you could advise it ( but as far as i know EASA allows CPR5, CR3 & EB, so , please could you clarify please?
Thanks in advance.
P.D, would be nice from you, because i spent (as others) long time asking for a clarification about the differences between computers, and never got an answer from you guys.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Ramiro there is not any EASA approved mechanical flight/nav computer. According to students' feedback, the most known and reliable mechanical computers seem to be CRP-5 and E6B.
ATPLQ cannot recommend you what to buy, because it would be an unfair trade practice. There are several mechanical computers in the market and you should better advise, firstly, your flight school and, secondly, fora, social media and any other appropriate source to get informed for the appropriate mechanical computer for your exams.
As mentioned in a past reponse to your comments, the team has reviewed the explanation many times and it is correct.
- Name: jimbee
  Comment: step by step

1. first of all, it must be clear which information from the table is required --> W/V 165/055 & temp. -25C
2. convert CAS to TAS, I use the CR-3 computer for this. Set PA opposite temp and read TAS from 155 CAS --> TAS = 174
3. Now we need the effective TAS. Formula: eTAS = TAS x cos (sin-1 (wind / TAS)) = 174 x cos (sin-1 (55/174)= 165.07
4. Now we have to find the HWC: cos(245-165) x 55 = 9.55
5. last but not least: eTAS - HWC= 165.07 - 9.55 = 155.52

my last subject, good luck to all of you guys
- Name: aviator786
  Comment: guys, I have been doing these questions for a while now and figured out that the best thing to do is 1) try out doing trig and if you get an answer listed then thats the answer. IF this brings about a value that is not one of the options or is in. between two options use your CRP5.
here you do not need to bother with converting CAS to TAS as they give TAS 175. you still get right answer using their TAS given.
- Name: GGeri
  Comment: Why is everyone calculating? The conditions are just the same in both departure times, the GS remains the same.
- Name: Christian
  Comment: The answer is supposed to be 163..
COS(245-165)x55 is 10(your headwind)
After getting a TAS of 174 from the CRP, you subtract the 10 kt headwind to get a ground speed of approximately 163.

Any recent feedback on this?
- Name: Veronika
  Comment: Just a hint. Look at original FP calculations. Wind is the SAME. So only temperature changed, changing TAS from 175 to 173. Respectively GS will also change by 2 knots and become 155 instead of 157.
I still made all possible mistakes with CRP5 before I got to that point..

"So, the required cruise time to cover the cruise distance of 150 NM is: Distance / TAS = 150 NM / 397 kt = 0.38 hr"

Here should be GS, not TAS
- Name: Pawcio
  Comment: TAS = 422, GS = 397, distance 150NM
397 -- 60 min
150 -- X, so:
150x60/397 = 23 min (theoretically it is 0,38 of hour, but exactly it is 0,383333), but counting in this way:
If 1869 is FF/h, in 23 min we will burn 716,45, and this answer differ enough to make confusion.

  Comment: I calculated this without corrections and i got 706,56.
- Name: PPEV03
  Comment: Twin engine result x2
- Name: EduardVelichkov
  Comment: TAT is different of OAT. The formula is:
TAT=SAT(1+0.2M^2)
TAT - total air temperature
SAT - static air temperature in Kelvins = OAT
M - mach number
With constant OAT (SAT) at these altitudes, the MACH number is the only thing that can change. They've calculated this for us.
The OAT is measured in still air conditions. In order to calculate OAT we have to bring the air at rest. At TAS of 400+ the dynamic pressure and temperature increases. This formula takes this into account.

  Comment: Thanks for reply @PullUp
Thats ok on this one but some I didnt really get the method of doing some more complicated ones, then I figured how to do it all on the calculator so Im happy with this method now :)
- Name: PullUp
  Comment: @Seanmul89 Interpolation is straightforward on this one:

921(kg/h) + 1006(kg/h) = 1927/2 = 963.5(kg/h)
[divide by 2 because you are looking for 52,500 which is halfway between 50,000 and 55,000]
963.5(kg/h) x 2 (two engine aircraft) = 1927 (kg/h) less 3% for temp. correction = 1869.19 (kg/h)

Same concept with the airspeed
425kt + 439kt = 864/2 = 432 less 10kt for temp correction = 422kt
Then adjust again for the 25kt headwind in the question = 397kt

  Comment: @aerialScope, they never mention ISA temperature; instead, they refer to standard temperature (which according to the table is -32). In this exercise, forget about ISA.

Moreover, if you solve the exercise without applying the corrections, you will still get the correct result:
TAS 432
GS 407
The trip time will be 22 minutes. You consume 353 liters per engine in 22 minutes. Multiply this amount by 2, and you'll get 706. Maybe it's not valid for all exercises, but it is for this one.
- Name: AerialScope
  Comment: Why would the ISA temp at FL370 would be -32 degC and not -56.5 degC ?? Where does this come from ??
I found +14.5 ISA Temp Deviation (warmer air, less performance) resulting in a TAS of 446.5kt (432 + 14.5kt) and a FF/ENG of around 1005kg/h considering a 4,35% increase in consumption due to warmer air

Overall it resulted in a GS of 421.5kt so 21,2 mins for 150NM, which would require 357kg of fuel per engine so around 715kg TOTAL fuel required, I went with the option 707kg as it seemed the closest to pick but still managed to find the correct answer

Question Number: AT00126
- Name: Ayoub13
  Comment: Please why Note: MZFM does not limit fuel
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello @Ayoub13, thank you for your comment. In this question, the Maximum Zero Fuel Mass (MZFM) is not limiting the extra fuel that can be carried because the Actual Zero Fuel Mass (62700 kg) is below the MZFM (62731 kg). The main limits to consider when planning for extra fuel are related to the Regulated Take-Off Mass, Maximum Landing Mass, and the aircraft's fuel tank capacity. Since the MZFM is not exceeded, it does not impose a restriction on the ability to carry extra fuel. Therefore, the calculation for extra fuel primarily considers the difference between the Regulated Take-Off Mass and the sum of the Actual Zero Fuel Mass plus Minimum Block Fuel, as well as ensuring all limits, such as the Maximum Landing Mass and Fuel Tank Capacity, are respected.
- Name: Skydaddy
  Comment: Seen hcaa zfm was different number
- Name: sergioramirezg
  Comment: The reason why we don't consider the option MZFM + T/O Fuel is that we don't know our final T/O fuel yet, because it will depend on the extra fuel we decide to carry.

- Name: Vertical
  Comment: Regulated Take-Off Mass: 76000 kg + Taxi Fuel: 240 kg (burned before TO)
= 76240 kg
minus Actual Zero Fuel Mass: 62700 kg
= 13540 kg possible Fuel (fits in the tank and more than minimum block fuel)
minus Trip Fuel: 10000 kg + Taxi Fuel: 240 kg
= 3300 kg Extra Fuel ?!

Why 440?! Minimum Block fuel is no limitation for more Fuel?! Pls help!!
- Name: Christian
  Comment: @motomoko because our limiting weight is 76000kg which is the RTOM. From this we just need to calculate what we actually have, which is 62700kg AZFM, plus the fuel we will have upon takeoff. This will be 13,100kg block fuel minus the 240kg taxi fuel because we have already burnt that up on taxi. This equals 12,860kg fuel on takeoff.
Add this to the AZFM and we get 75,560. The final step is to subtract this from our RTOM of 76,000kg to get a spare amount of 440kg.

Hope this helps!

  Comment: I have got an algorithm for all questions related to EXTRA FUEL:
1. Actual mass:
a)AZFM=DOM+TL
b)ATOM=AZFM+TOF
C)ALM=ATOM-TF
d)ARM = ATOM + TAXI FUEL (sometimes is given)

2. Find lowest value:
a)MTOM-ATOM=
b)MLM-ALM= ... + fuel penalty (if is given - not necessary at all questions)
c) TANK CAPACITY - TAXI FUEL - TOF = (capacity - min. BF = 0) - the lowest value and the algorithm is working in this case too
d)MRM - ARM = (sometimes maximum ramp mass is given)

Remarks:
Sometimes we should decide which mass shall be limited to take-off (RTOM or Optimum Weight - from the graph we know that lower mass is Optimum Weight).
Sometimes we shall decide what is MTOM: RTOM or MTOM or Optimal Weight. Always the lowest mass is correct.

  Comment: Because you burn 240 taxi before take off ,so 200extra+240taxi

  Comment: Compare Massess -
TOM=(Actual)ZFM+Block Fuel - Taxi
TOM=62700+13100-240=75560 =====>(MTOM-TOM)=>76000-75560=440kg

LM=(Actual)TOM-Trip Fuel
LM=75560-10000=65560 MLM-LM=66360-65560=800kg

Fuel Tank Capacity= 16000kg
Capacity - Block Fuel = 16000kg-13100kg=2900kg

Compare masses and choose the lowest .

You will ask , why lowest ? Dunno but its correct.

- Name: Lukas150152
  Comment: I've chosen wrong answer also, but what I think they mean by the right answer is that even though it IS a FLYBY Waypoint, the point itself CANNOT by any circumstance be used by a 737, because it has to use a different routing. Therefore it is just semantics, it's not meant that for a 737 it is a fly over waypoint or whatever, it just says, that it cannot use the point, that's why it's excluded. The little (1) symbol can be seen flipped 90 degrees next to the point if you zoom in a lot.

so why do they even include the B737 reference?

  Comment: Hi @Vakov. The waypoint EHØ48 is a fly-by waypoint for departing aircraft following the RNAV procedure, except for the B737. The information box located near the top of the chart contains a black circle with the number "1" inside and the statement “B737 only.”
- Name: TB20Sam
  Comment: Agree with @MCDavies and @NikoLg. It's a fly-by waypoint, full stop. There is no RNAV waypoint type called "Fly-by waypoint except for B737". The fact that it isn't used by the B737 on this procedure doesn't change the fact that it's a fly-by waypoint. It's probably not often used by Cessna 152s either, but that also doesn't change what type of waypoint it is.

To make this question more reasonable EASA need to get rid of the 'fly-by waypoint' option, or change it to 'fly-by waypoint used by all aircraft types on this procedure' or something like that.
- Name: Lolobricolo
  Comment: I just understand that because EH080 is a fly over for 737 only, they don't care (B737) about EH048. They have their own point to fly over. Logically, EH048 is a fly by for all aircraft except the B737.
Hope it's clear

  Comment: Track to a waypoint doesnt make it fly over waypoint

1. For RNAV departures (excluding B737): Fly on a 183° track to EHØ48, then to EHØ49, SPY, BETUS, and ANDIK.
2. For B737 departures: Fly on a 183° track to EH080, then switch to a 030° track to EH057, and continue to SPY, BETUS, and ANDIK.
So, based on these routes, we can figure out that EHØ48 is a fly-by waypoint for aircraft following the RNAV procedure other than B737.
I hope this makes sense!

  Comment: The correct answer "fly-by, except B737" implicates that the waypoint shall be seen as a fly-over waypoint by all aircraft of type B737. Very bad wording.
- Name: Daniel
  Comment: What a coincidence! Today Austro NL. As if they read my yesterdays comment.
The question is reworded. It now reads:
'What is the purpose of EH048'.

Same answer. Now makes more sense.
- Name: Daniel
  Comment: Maybe this helps a bit to reduce the confusion: By its graphical representation EH048 is a fly-by waypoint.
So if we stick to the exact wording of the question 'what does EH048 indicate', the correct answer is 'a fly-by waypoint' (also for B737 aircraft)

But B737 departing from 180C are instructed not to make use of EH048. Not making use of it, in normal logic, does not change the fact that it is (indicating) a fly-by waypoint. (if you take another road, the road you are not taking is still a road)
However in EASA logic it does.

Hence another example of poor EASA wording/questioning.

  Comment: Michal is spot on. B737 route does not include EH048 and EH049, they are supposed to turn after passing EH080.
The reasoning? Well the only explanation I find plausible is that 2017 the authorities wanted for any reason a defined turn radius that fits B737 nav Perf (mostly Noise). Note that in the recent charts there is no more BETUS 3Y but a BETUS 5Y where different Noise Procedure is used uniform to all A/C. Why am i telling you that? I dont know, maybe to help cope the frustration in this question, but Michal is spot on. Guys read the note for 737 below, then the correct answer is "the most correct one"
- Name: AIRPORTDISSSWAYYY
  Comment: Seen today UKCAA. Worded much better & from what I gathered EH080 is a FLY OVER waypoint that ONLY the 737 can use, all other aircrafts must use EH048 instead which is a fly by waypoint. @ATPLQ

Hope this helps.
- Name: Hannes
  Comment: With "except for 737" they probably mean that EH048 is not part of the departure route of the 737 and does not refer to fly by, but to the waypoint itself. Badly worded
- Name: Radoslaw
  Comment: SO what the question should be like? What does EH080 indicate, OR what does it mean for the departures. Beacuse strictly what indicates is Fly by point ONLY
- Name: Ivo
  Comment: I think it is an exception for B737, in the sense that, it is not even considered part of the route.

Ex: if the chart was just for B737 the wpt EH048 wouldn't be there.. you would only see SPL ->EH080 ->EH057 -> SPY etc.

I hope it helps.

Notice that B737 should fly to EH080 and then to EH057! So B737 does not have EH048 on its route
- Name: Michal
  Comment: While chart clearly says that EH080 is B737 only flyover point. EH 048 seems just fly-by for everyone..
- Name: Harro
  Comment: I agree with my companions here, there is an RNAV tag, at the bottom of the plate, where EH048 is mentioned and as the symbol says a flyby waypoint. Below is the exception for the B737 and there is nothing about EH049! It says: On 183 track to EH080, 030 track to EH057, to SPY, to BETUS, to ANDIK - nothing about EH048. In the plate written above EH080 is Fly-over for B737 only which as far as I see it relevant for EH080 For EH080 is not mentioned in the RNAV description.
- Name: Daniel
  Comment: For me EH048 is just another fly by waypoint. I dont see how the restriction applies here.
- Name: Daniel
  Comment: I think the wording is just confusing and EH048 is not part of the 737 procedure at all
- Name: Jacob
  Comment: I still find this incorrect. For B737, the point EH080 is not mentioned at all. I could accept that it is fly-by for 737 (just like for everyone else), or that it is not part of the B737 route at all, but it is definitely not a mandatory fly-over point for 737.
- Name: Alexx1215
  Comment: I have to disagree with this one. It's written that EH080 is a fly over for a 737. It's not written that EH048 is a fly over for the boeing.

  Comment: ICAO Document 8168, Volume I - Sixth Edition - Procedures for Air Navigation Services - AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, Flight Procedures, herein known as PANS-OPS

1.4.1 The minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) value to be applied in the primary area for the enroute phase of an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight is 300 m (1000 ft). In mountainous areas, this shall be increased depending on the variation in terrain elevation as follows:

Variation in terrain elevation__MOC
Between 900 m (3000 ft) and 1500 m (5000 ft)__450 m (1476 ft)
Greater than 1500 m (5000 ft)__600 m (1969 ft)

1.4.2 The MOC to be applied outside the primary area is normally equal to half the value of that applied in the primary area. Primary area plus buffer area, equal 10 NM each side of track. Primary area 5 NM, buffer area 5 NM. Where this is found to be too constraining an alternative method is to use a value which reduces from the full MOC at the edge of the primary area to zero at the outer edge of the secondary area.

1.4.3 Minimum obstacle clearance altitude (MOCA). The MOCA is the minimum altitude for a defined segment that provides the required MOC. A MOCA is determined and published for each segment of the route.
- Name: SkyHawkFINISHED
  Comment: MOC is the sum of maximum terrain or obstacle elevation, the higher, plus:

Terrain elevation Up to 3000 ft: MOC = + 300 m (1000ft)
Terrain elevation 3000 - 5000 ft: MOC = + 450 m (1500ft)
Terrain elevation Over 5000 ft: MOC = + 600 m (2000ft)

ROUNDED TO THE NEXT 100ft!!
- Name: SkyHawkFINISHED
  Comment: From @Matthieu in another question:

After investigation I found that MOC and MOCA are DIFFERENT

ICAO 8168 Does Defines MOC only (NOT MOCA)
EASA Air Ops Does define MOCA only (NOT moc)

easa air ops:
(i) moca is the sum of:
(a) the maximum terrain or obstacle elevation, whichever is higher; plus
(b)1 000 ft for elevation up to and including 6 000 ft; or
(c)2 000 ft for elevation exceeding 6 000 ft rounded up to the next 100 ft.
(ii)the lowest moca to be indicated is 2 000 ft.

icao 8168:
the moc value to be applied in the primary area for the en-route phase of an ifr flight is 300 m (1 000 ft)
in mountainous areas, this shall be increased depending on: variation in terrain elevation:
between 900 m (3 000 ft) and 1 500 m (5 000 ft) moc = 450 m (1 476 ft)
greater than 1 500 m (5 000 ft) moc=600 m (1 969 ft)
- Name: Rotorfly
  Comment: I am sorry, but I cant find anything in my Documents and ICAO Docs.
Is concerning the MHA a "mountainous threshold" defined like with MOCA "> 5000 ft"
Or is MOCA part of MHA?
Because at the end with MHA, we are focussing again on the minimum obstacle clearance again, so the ruleset of MOCA could apply?

With other words: If the terrain elevation in that question would be lets say 4925 ft, what would be the required minimum obstacle clearance?

  Comment: @CJLEE CRP-5 is needed. With CRP-5 you get aprox GS 290, and it is 20.68 min --> 21 min. For small drift, that formula is good enough, but it isn't exact formula, due to the fact that we are using the track instead of the heading.

  Comment: the True Heading must be calculated to take the WCA into account. Use the CRP5, go for True Heading 090, insert the wind. Now you can see Drift is 17° Right. This means our Heading is 073°. Now you can read the Groundspeed which is 285.

  Comment: With CRP 5 you will get 290kts (GS). 100NM / 290 kts x 60 = 20,7' = 21 minutes.
If you use CRP 5 don't forget to do the correction for drift (Correction applies when we use Track or Course, if you have heading you don't do the correction.) -> In this case you get 16 (R) drift -> So, 90 - 16 = 74 degrees and you get the GS 290.

CRP 5 is definitely more precise than the calculation, be careful guys.

  Comment: Different method from @Quesair, but same result

If WCA >=10 we need to apply ETAS.

WCA = XW*60/TAS = 100*sin(60)*60/350 = 14.8

ETAS = TAS*cos(WCA) = 350*cos(14.8) = 338 kts

GS = 338 - 100*cos(60) = 288 kts

Time to fly 100 NM = 100/288 = 0.3468 = 20 m 48 s = 21 min
- Name: quesair
  Comment: This is not wrong using math, but you must know that when calculating headwind or tailwind component we need to be using HEADING in calculation and not TRACK. With TRACK we can calculate DRIFT ANGLE:

DRIFT ANGLE = sin(angle) x wind speed x 60/TAS --> where angle is difference between track and wind direction.
= sin 60 x 100 x 60 / 350 = 14.8

So wind is blowing us 14.8 degree away from our heading. Heading is always towards the wind.
HDG = track - + drift angle
= 90 - 14.8 = 75

Now use that for headwind calculation..
75-30 = 45 --> hdg and wind direction difference
cos(45) x 100kt = 70kts --> headwind

TAS - headwind = 280kt = gs
100nm / 280kt = 0.357h = 21min

remember drift formula aka wind correction formula for gen nav. you will need it

Headwind or tailwind = cos60 x 100 = 50kt

In this case the wind is coming from the front, so we only need to calculate headwind. The crosswind formula is there just for your information.

Gs = 350 - 50 = 300kt

100 nm at 300kt = 20 min
- Name: Subzero
  Comment: * I copied the question so you don't go back and forward follow my steps below they are very simple:-

Given the following information, what is the expected leg time?
Leg track : 090
Distance : 100 NM
TAS : 350 kt
Wind : 030/100 kt

Steps:-
1) set TAS 350
2) set 030/100 kt and mark a dot under 350 by 100kts so dot has to be over ''250kts''.

3) turn the crp to 090 track but here is the confusing part but you have to belive me the flight computer is designed for you to keep the heading at the top not the track here is why many people get this question wrong they stop at 090 and read the GS which is 302kts and when you calculate it from here
T= 100nm/302 kts = 19mins and 52 seconds, if you don't do this additional step your calculations will always be wrong and your answer will be abit not clear as in you will land at the wrong option.

4) so your at track 090 you need heading at the top if you notice you have a dot on the right side at 16 degrees, you need to move the flight computer 16 degrees to the right, so when you move it 16 degrees right your heading at the top has to be 074 and now you read your ''GS which is equal to 286kts''

5) T = D/V = 100nm/286kts = 20mins 58 seconds almost 21 mins.

So if you stop in step 3 you will always get the wrong answer, hope this helps see you in the skies.

  Comment: If you use CRP-5 and apply 90 degrees as track, you end up calculating your true heading is 76 degrees. Then, applying in the CRP-5 30/100 wind to a TAS of 350Kts and TH 76 degrees, you get GS is 290. 100nm/290kts = 20,7 minutes (closer to 21'). Way better to use CRP-5 as margin between answers can be confusing i think

- Name: Sam
  Comment: This one is quite simple without the formula and using CRP 5 instead. Once you've calculated the GS, then it's a simple DST calc.

1) We already know the distance (100nm) so that's one half.
2) Now we need to calculate GS using CRP5 so... using the high-speed side of the computer, input your wind. Now, move the slider up until the dot is over a TAS of 350kts and align your true heading arrow with the leg track. Then you simply balance the ball. You can see that at the moment your GS dot is over the 16 degrees drift mark, so move your whizz wheel to the right until 90 is over 16 degrees. BUT now the GS dot is over 15 degrees, so move it back until 90 is over 15. Now read off what your GS is. It should be 285kts.
3) Now, you plug the numbers into the DST triangle and do 100/285 = 21minutes

Hope it helps! Sorry, it’s confusing as I can't explain it better without showing you!
- Name: Michael
  Comment: It may be easier to just use your calculator to get a more accurate answer:

cos(60)*100 = 50kts Headwind
GS=300kts
Time = 100nm/300kts = 0.3333 --> ogg button --> 20 minutes ~ 21 minutes

Hope this helps!
- Name: Massimiliano
  Comment: its more corrected like Jon wrote, there is a difference of 15° degrees from heading and track of the segment, this makes the real GS be 288 Kts, be more accurate on other question because this was quitely gentle, other question asks for 1 kt of difference

So just remember 80 NM and 20 knots head wind an you will have the magic number of 822 as an answer. Sorry but after failed this exam due to lack of time I am sick of it :))

  Comment: Ok so I just make it simple
(108-55)x(80-50)/50=31.8
31.8+55=87
Down
(0.9-0.6)x(87-50)/50=0,222
0,222+0.6=0.822=822 kg

  Comment: these interpolations are actually the easiest, don't make it to complicated for yourself! Just calculate in % for example: we want those 80 NM exactly in Air Miles -> 80 is 60% between 50 and 100 (80-50 / 50) = 0.6 * (108-55) = 31.8 + 55 = 86.8 NAM -> now do the same with the lower table und you get 0.822t (822kg) exactly!
Hope it helps you, I do it like this every single time end never got any of these wrong (will also help you for the performance subject if you have not done it yet!) Good luck guys!

- Name: boyerj6
  Comment: If it helps:
Top:
(108 / 100) x 80 NGM = 86 NAM
Bottom:
Air Distance = 100 - 50 NAM = 50 NAM
Weight = 900 kg - 600 kg = 300 kg
Top Distance = 86 NAM - 50 NAM = 36 NAM
50 NAM = 300 KG
36 NAM = x
50x = (300 x 36) = 10,800 kg
10,800 / 50 = 216
600kg + 216 = 816 kg..close enough

[(108 - 55) ÷ 50 ] x 30 = 31.8
31.8 + 55 = 86.8 or 87

Second chart
[(0.9-0.6) ÷ 50 ] x 37 = 0.222
0.22 + 0.6 = 0.822kg

Landing weight (1000kg)

- Name: Simon Posner
  Comment: The calculation is VERY VERY SIMPLE!

Endurance is block fuel - taxi fuel. So 181-3=178Kg.
We know the 100Kg = 1h:35min
So simple relationship:
178Kg/100Kg x 1:35 (or type into calculator 95 min) = 2.818, or DMS 2h49min

- Name: Sam
  Comment: 1hr 35mins (use DMS on calculator to input) then /100 = 57seconds/kg fuel

57seconds (input using DMS buton) x 78kg (which was 81kg - taxi fuel) = 1hr 14mins then add this to the initial trip time based on 100kg trip fuel.

1hr 14 + 1hr 35 = 2hr 49mins
- Name: Michal
  Comment: Block Fuel - Taxi Fuel= 181 kg - 3 kg= 178 kg

- Name: Cam787
  Comment: @TheFastMario because of the localiser frequency being 118.3 it is not an ILS Frequency it is VDF
- Name: TheFastMario
  Comment: Why is ILS wrong?
- Name: Mariel
  Comment: I can't find anything about having to know which frequency belongs to what nav aid in the FPM syllabus, so I think this question should be appealed.
- Name: klappan
  Comment: This question is unambiguous and clear. You can rule out VOR/ILS due to frequency band. They explicitly state that a standby transmitter provides services within the reduced range, so ATC clearances continue to be available.
This process of elimination leaves only VDF as an option.
If you read the question carefully, it reads VDF "might" not be available. It also might be. It doesn't matter if it is.
- Name: AdinaChahine
  Comment: VOR operates between 108.0 / 117.95 MHz, so the one left with VHF would be VDF. I almost went into the same trap
- Name: kubarybaczyk
  Comment: I had this question today in polish ULC, can confirm that what is marked here is still the correct answer (I trusted the bank and it was a good decision), good luck!
- Name: kubarybaczyk
  Comment: BS it sould be a receiver if anything, VDF "locates" bearings to transmitting aircraft, it doesn't need a transmitter..
- Name: DoubleTango
  Comment: VDF = VHF Direction Finding
- Name: CaptainChris
  Comment: The VDF uses aerials for reception/sensing and not a transmitter. For reporting back your request for QDM/QDR the ground station would need to do a transmission. And if the station wants to call you for this reason and is unable due to a defect in the transmitter it would also be unable to do so with an ATC clearance. So for me the latter seems to make more sense. But both is a compromise..
- Name: Pawel
  Comment: ILS or VOR are out of frequency range (111,95 and 117,95) and a "ATC clerances" is just nonsens.

- Name: DanielD93
  Comment: Question and answer might be nonsense.. but if this comes up we know now that VDF is the answer so an easy mark. No need to appeal easy wins out of righteousness.
- Name: Alberto
  Comment: A lot of basis to appeal this question, the whole explanation just assumes its not ATC Clearances because they would said so if it was ( They wouldve specified another frequency ).
- Name: dave011
  Comment: VDF is not a transmitter
- Name: Joshua
  Comment: 100% appealable. A ground VDF station is a receiver not a transmitter, using completely different hardware and completely independent from the ground transmitter. As long as an aircraft can transmit on the normal frequency for VDF, and the ground station can communicate to the aircraft the QDM/QDR/QTE/QUJ, the VDF service is available
- Name: hello545
  Comment: Not VOR cause such operates within : 108.0 117.975 MHz
- Name: WillB
  Comment: If you look at the E(LO) 1 chart and find Kirkwall (north of WIK VOR ,approx 59N 03W) 118.3 is the AFIS frequency. Therefore NO clearances can be given by an AFIS, advisory only.

The only other option is VDF.

- Name: CaptainChris
  Comment: Interesting. In such cases you can simply take twice the TAS in the denominator since for GS Home and GS Out you would have the same wind component. And if you sum up the summands you will have one plus the wind component and one minus the wind component. It will save time to simply take 2xTAS in the denominator.

Question Number: AT00141
- Name: Hughesl88
  Comment: It says we have to land with 350 lb - according to the FP, we're landing at Delta, so why do we not take into account the fuel needed to get to Delta before calculating the holding endurance over Charlie? Or is the question implying that we're landing at Charlie now? These q are too vague and make far too many assumptions sometimes.
- Name: Santipri

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Anezka, thank you for your comment. The fuel consumption calculation is determined according to the inputs in the question and the annex, not the last leg. This question assumes that there is no change in the actual fuel flow. Therefore, even if you calculate between different legs (A-B, B-C, A-C), there will be no change in the fuel flow (per hour).

  Comment: Hi @CharlieBravo. We have updated the explanation. Thank you for your valuable feedback.
- Name: Yannick27
  Comment: This is what i didn't get. Your explanation plans on holding over charlie using all the fuel minus the fuel you want on landing. So we forgot about reaching Delta at all?? I did my calculation estimating the fuel needed for the trek to Delta (over Delta with 2582lb in the tanks) and removing the fuel we want to keep on landing (2582 - 350 = 2232lb). So 2232lb is the fuel we won't need for the whole trip, which we can burn on holding.

Which gives us 172 minutes of holding approx. (with a 780lb/h burn rate) which is 2h52.
Of course that answer isn't available.. I hope the answers on the real exam weren't correctly reported and the explanation made a mistake in their logic, otherwise this is maddening.. you do the correct assumptions and they hit you with unrealistic and unapplicable solutions for real-world application..
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello @Yannick27! The question simply requires you to calculate the safe endurance at Charlie, which is derived by subtracting the reserves from the total fuel remaining at Charlie and then dividing by the fuel flow. There's no need to factor in the Charlie-Delta segment. The question aims to assess how long you can fly without tapping into reserves. I hope this clarifies things!

- Name: MoritzV
  Comment: For the fellas who have some problem with the calculation.Try to understand the P I T mnemonics. It is very easy and clear if you keep it in mind. You can easily go from PA to TA and vice versa
- Name: Cristiano91
  Comment: I came out with a mnemonic for these: PAPIATTA

PA(P)IA(T)TA: PA is pressure altitude, or standard setting. IA is indicated altitude, which is the altitude you read on the secondary altimeter. TA is true altitude, which is the real altitude the plane will fly at. P and T are pressure and temperature corrections.

In this case:

We have a TA of 5600, we ADD (T) since it is lower than ISA (5600/1000*4*15) and we have IA, then we ADD again (P) since it is lower than the standard 1013 (30x23) to get our PA.
Reverse the signs if you are going from PA to TA, depending on Qnh and isa deviation.
- Name: Marguez
  Comment: Actually if you know the rules of the altimetry you can solve it using logic with no calculations. We are flying eastwards so it has to be an odd level, we also need to fly at at least 5600 feet for separation and the only odd FL above that is FL70. Also, knowing that the temperature and qnh are lower than standard, we will have to correct by flying a bit higher, leaving us with just one logical answer. I dont know if I explained myself well, anyway I hope it was useful, good luck mates
- Name: Maksym
  Comment: Sometimes we do first "QNH correction' then we add TEMP correction.
5600 + 23x30 = 6290
(6290 : 1000) x 4 x 15 = 377
6290 + 377 = 6667

This time we do vice versa.
(5600 : 1000) x 4 x 15 = 336
336 + 5600 = 5936
5936 + 23x30 = 6626

I dont't get it. The result differs not too much but it does!
can you explain?
- Name: Richard
  Comment: Thank you @Quesair !!!
This is my last exam and nowhere I could find the proper order, and it seemed like in all the other exams it was just an ambiguous choice..

Made my own mnemonic out of it:
QNH = QTP >> Temperature Correction first, and then Pressure Correction.
Flight Level = FPT >> Pressure Correction first and then Temperature Correction.
- Name: scharj7x
  Comment: You don't need to calculate: It is at least 5.600 ft + corrections. It is east so we have an odd level and there is only one above 5.600 (FL70).
- Name: Zariff
  Comment: I don't understand what I do but works every time
- Name: quesair
  Comment: Always do temperature correction with QNH.
So:
- if you are on FL you have to first get QNH altitude, and after calculate temperature correction.
- if you are on QNH altitude, first do the temperature correction and if question asks you about FL, do the pressure correction next. --> this question
- Name: Chacon
  Comment: No calculations needed, the FL that can be used its 70 because the clearance with 50 its not enought and the FL rule says only can be 70 or 50 but the only answer possible wil be FL70
- Name: Therwi
  Comment: Guys, just remember: ISA below (+), QNH lower than 1013 (+) when going from TRUE to INDICATED. Than look at track, FL will be either 50 or 70 in this case. But since your minimum altitude is 4600+1000 and you have to ADD temp. correction and ADD pressure correction, the answer is FL70. You can do some of these questions even without calculating and save some time. Wish you all the best of luck.

  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL).
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

  Comment: I calculated the temp corr. from 5600ft bc there is no MET Elev given.. still got the correct answer.. why should i only take the 1000ft into consideration? anyone can explain?
- Name: Nick
  Comment: Can someone please confirm that we're still doing the temp correction between where you NEED to be (i.e. 1000ft above the obstacle) and the obstacle? So we're still assuming the obstacle is the MET station when no aerodrome/met station elevation is given?
- Name: kosta
  Comment: don't even bother appealing. everyone that has tried, has gotten rejected apparently.
EASA knows very well that what they're doing is wrong, and that this is not the way to solve this question, but they're stubborn. they want it their way.

anyways, for flight planning specifically, if there is an obstacle, that obstacle should be considered as the meteo station for the temperature correction
- Name: Olstan
  Comment: I am also confused, you said if no elevation for MET location then assume sea level, which would be 4600ft below the top of the obstacle?
If you are only doing temp correction for 1000ft, surely you are saying the MET elevation is 3600ft?
- Name: Saba
  Comment: How can you not use the obstacle height??
We have to fly over the mountain, it's not the aerodrome elevation so shouldn't 5600ft be used for temperature correction not 1000ft? There's just no winning with these questions, i have spent hours doing these questions but every time there's this little trick you miss.
I have my exam this following week, please let me know if this is appealable or not?
- Name: Assan
  Comment: I think the temperature correction shouldnt apply above the obstacle unless it states its a station or mountain. In either case the answer is still FL70.
- Name: Bajok
  Comment: do we always assume its IFR when its not stated vfr or ifr?
- Name: Eren
  Comment: These Q are crap from EASA, as long you understand the actual concept take these questions as exceptions and remember to take as obstacle height as meteo station height.

- Name: Dimitris
  Comment: what about 337501 @atplquestions ?
Could you please tell us which method is the correct one?!
THANK YOU.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Dimitris! This is what the 050 LOs tells us:

"State that the 4 per cent-rule can be used to calculate true altitude from indicated altitude, and also indicated altitude from true altitude (not precise but sufficient due to the approximation of the 4 per cent-rule.)
Remark: The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
a. All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
b. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 700 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
c. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 per cent-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4 per cent for each 10 deg C temperature deviation from ISA.
d. If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be constantly the same given value in the whole layer.
e. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the ground and the position of the aircraft."
The temperature correction should be made to the column of air between the aircraft and the meteo station/aerodrome. This is not 100% clear and it seems that EASA themselves don't know how to apply this rule. For personal experience, it seems that whenever they don't mention that the obstacle is isolated, they apply the temperature correction from the aircraft to the ground. However, this is not confirmed and it's only from experience.
The explanation for this question will be reviewed. Thanks a lot!
- Name: vitor
  Comment: @atpl, now you apply temperature correction between ground and aircraft position (5600 ft)!! and it's correct!! Please read my comment on question 339725 and you will understand. something is not right with the method that you or the CAA's are applying.
- Name: Luis
  Comment: Excellent Dominic
- Name: Dominic
  Comment: for all these questions just understand the following:

if they ask for true altitude:
start with pressure and follow with the temperature. if temperature is higher, you add the result, if the temperature is lower you subtract the result. if pressure is higher you add the result, if the pressure is lower you subtract the result.
in other words, plus in the question is a plus in the answer and minus in the question is a minus in the answer. this goes for both pressure and temperature.

if they ask for flight level:
start with temperature and follow with the pressure. if temperature is higher, you subtract the result, if the temperature is lower you add the result. if pressure is higher you subtract the result, if the pressure is lower you add the result.
in other words with flight level, its the opposite where a plus in the question is a minus in the answer and vice versa.

also remember that temperature changes are calculated from the elevation of the station from where it has been taken.
- Name: Radoslaw
  Comment: @ATPLQ In question 339725 is no word about station, but you calculated as obstacle height would be the station.. here you say if no word about station = sea level.. can you be consistent? Its really hard without you causing confusion. If you think one is not good, remove that question or mark down clearly that q. should be appealed. Do not make different contradicting calculations for same kind questions.
- Name: Renato
  Comment: @ATPL Why apply temp correction first and not pressure?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Renato, to get pressure altitude or a flight level to pick first temperature correction then pressure correction. To find true altitude first pressure correction then temperature correction should be applied.

  Comment: FL80 as MEA which is already below 10000ft nice and easy but of course i have to over complicate my life during an emergency descend to get to a lower altitude which is also impossible to fly with the autopilot. And all this crap to get just approximately 800ft lower? This answer is completely out of reality.
- Name: Tbal69
  Comment: I'm confused. the question asks for the minimum permitted altitude or FL along the STAR procedure. FL80 is the MEA according to the procedure, the answer of 7110 is not a permitted altitude iaw the published procedure, so doesn't actually answer the question.
- Name: NicoleB94
  Comment: Hello, could you please explain why it's not 6110ft since it is an emergency descent and we are talking about MSA here and not MOCA? MSA is always 1000ft according to FAA and ICAO definitions. Why do we have to add 2000ft then? From my understanding the 2000ft obstacle clearance doesn't apply for MSA. Thanks !

- Name: Solicab
  Comment: So guys, as per Jeppesen definitions, they are asking here about not MORA but GRID MORA:

Grid MORA clear all terrain and man-made structures by 1000ft in areas where the highest elevations are 5000ft MSL or LESS . . . . MORA values clear all terrain and man-made structures by 2000ft in areas where the highest elevations are 5001ft or higher.

Since we are outside the MSA (not within 25nm from VOR) we should apply GRID MORA
- Name: Bende
  Comment: I had this question today (Austro) and 7110 was correct
- Name: TB20Sam
  Comment: Thinking through my own comment below, I guess FL80 doesn't guarantee any obstacle clearance as it depends on the QNH. With a QNH below 983hPa then FL80 would be lower than 7110 feet and therefore insufficient obstacle clearance. So I guess that makes 7110 feet a better answer.
- Name: TB20Sam
  Comment: Why would they need to descend below the MEA of FL80? At that level they are sufficiently low for the depressurisation not to be a problem. If the MEA was FL130 or something like that then I could understand.

Question 338387 refers to 6000. Here we randomly shall use 5000.
"Normally, this gives 1000 ft clearance over obstacles up to and including 6000 ft and 2000 ft clearance for obstacles over 6000 ft in elevation. It is indicated on an en-route chart with "T" suffix to the minimum".

pls explain. thx.
- Name: cmcpilot
  Comment: Providing my own point of view on this based on what the given definitions are in text book;

MSA
in an emergency, pilot should descend NO LOWER than MSA.
MSA provides at least 1000ft obstacle clearance within specified radius.
The highest point on this chart in sector we are concerned about is 5110 ft.
5110 + 1000 ft = 6110 ft.
Rounded up to the nearest whole 100 ft means the MSA as depicted on the chart is 6,200 ft.

The MSA 6900ft is within 25nm of the VOR only. As the aircraft is not yet flying in this sector (since it is 20nm from BESOR) we can ignore this MSA.

MORA
Obstacle clearance over higher terrain provides 2000 ft where elevation exceeds 5000 ft.
Highest point in sector is 5110 ft. 5110 + 2000 ft = 7110 ft.

"In emergency, pilots should descend to the LOWEST SAFE ALTITUDE or 10,000 ft, whichever is higher. "

10,000 ft is not an answer to select from, so we assume it is looking for the lowest safe altitude.

now consider the options available;

6110 ft is msa - to low
6900 ft MSA within 25nm of NAV aid. The aircraft is 20nm from BESOR so not within this MSA. Ignore
fl80 is the mea and additionally is not the lowest safe altitude we can go to.
7110 ft is the mora and the lowest safe altitude

- Name: Marco
  Comment: could you please explain why grid is lower than 7110ft? is the chart wrong or what?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Marco. Here is a part of the description of GRID MORA in Jeppesen's introduction;
"Grid MORA values derived by Jeppesen clear all terrain and man-made structures by 1000 ft in areas where the highest elevations are 5000 ft MSL or lower. MORA values clear all terrain and man-made structures by 2000 ft in areas where the highest elevations are 5001 ft MSL or higher."
Since the highest elevation in the relevant Grid is 5110 ft, GRID MORA should be 7110 ft in that region. In the comment dated November 28, 2023, @JoaoD shared the version of the chart in this question that exists in the Spanish AIP, and it can be seen that GRID MORA is 7100 ft. Here it is: "Spain AIP -> https://photos.app.goo.gl/3z88B67KEBv4k7Gn6
As a result, there seems to be a conflict between the annex of this question and the relevant regulation. Regarding this question, we recommend that you solve the question without considering the GRID MORA shown in the annex. Thank you for your comment.
- Name: RajHamsaXAir

- Name: TheMegaDon
  Comment: @XavierNP, because the answer in this question is probably wrong, from operational procedures the rule is 1000ft obstacle clearance for elevations "up to and including 6000ft". But here they decided it's 2000ft for no apparent reason.
- Name: JoaoD
  Comment: Spain AIP -> https://photos.app.goo.gl/3z88B67KEBv4k7Gn6

As you can see, in the real chart the GRID altitude is 7100 ft (71)
Im not sure why its written 6200 (62) on this jeppesen chart ,because flying at that altitude would not guarantee the minimum terrain clearance, but the lowest "flyable" altitude should be the grid altitude.

In this case, since the grid altitude will not provide the minimum clearance, we are forced to spot the highest obstacle and add the required margin of 2000 ft to find our minimum altitude
- Name: jonathanlaukner

  Comment: Why is the Grid MORA saying 6200 ft when the highest obstacle is 5110 ft, so above 5000 ft?
Why is it not 5110 + 2000 = 7110 ft => 7200 ft Grid MORA rounded up to the next 100??
- Name: Alexandros
  Comment: I think I know the solution guys. So FL80 is the airway route which it has been already flying at during the STAR procedure. When the emergency occurred, the aircraft descents to the lowest possible height available.
The obstacle (or highest point) is 5110. Because it is in a small mountainous area, +2000ft MOCA.
Results in 7110ft

  Comment: Dear AtplQ,

In had this question at Austro Control (Belgium), slightly reworded something like You are between VLC Vor - Besor and perform an emergency descent. What is the min permitted Alt/FL along the STAR procedure ..? It did not say anything about Cabin Depressurization (I don't know if this change something). Answers exactly the same. I choosed 7110 ft instead of FL80. Unfortunately I do not know if it is the good answer but I appealed this question. If I'll have news from Austro I'll let you know.

All the best to everyone and keep on fighting one day it will be over

  Comment: This can't be right though. You're 20nn away from BESOR, not ATE VOR which is what the MSA is based on. You're out of ATE 25nm MSA range. At best you'd be clearing the 5110ft obstacle along the route by 2000ft according to the regulation, because it's over 5000ft high and is obviously a mountainous region.

- Name: Martin
  Comment: Those confused between 5NM and 10NM, think about the following:

The airway itself is made in such a way that you're safe within 5NM from the centerline. The route MORA is called "off route" so that in cases where you'd have to deviate significantly (more than the 5 NM either side of the corridor defined by the airway) you'll be safe. You could of course follow the grid MORA (and most airways don't even have a route MORA), but sometimes that's determined according to some mountain 50NM away from your position in a tiny corner of the grid box. So, to make it easier, Jeppesen (not the authorities) come up with this thing that will keep you safe up to 10NM away from the centerline. On the other hand, it's the authorities that guarantee you'll be safe within 5NM from the centerline, because they've designed the airway, not Jeppesen.

- Name: Ryan
  Comment: The answer given is correct, however the explanation given by ATPLQ is incorrect. The MORA is 10nm either side of the route centreline (therefore 20nm total width).
- Name: Saad
  Comment: The question asks about the distance from Centre line it should be 5. The total distance is 10. This so confusing.

  Comment: @Goktuk actually the MORA definition on page 15 of the definitions in the GSPRM is clear: 10 NM either side of route, as stated by the answer.

Emailed Austro about it and they will not even acknowledge it because i didn't comment on it during the exam so whatever you do make sure and appeal this and because I didn't they wouldn't up my score from 74.5 to 75% so this is the level of ity that is creating our exams folks, so just remember this, All the best

"5, because it's closest to 4."

And to be precise shouldn't we take the lower value in an emergency ? Telling ATC you have 200 kg of fuel isn't the same as actually having 150 kg right?

It was stated that because of a CB a diversion of 3 minutes was needed and finally asked for the revised ETO at KOGAS FIR. options were 18:15 18:16 18:18 or 18:21. not sure what is correct.

- Name: CptBelt
  Comment: I used 5 km / 1 NM calculation. Overall the distance to cover is 571. 571 x 5 = 2.855.
From that we can calculate the remaining fuel: 5.990 - 2.855 = 3.135
This is very close to the calculated value to the explanation, however far from any usuable answer possibilities. I don't get it.
- Name: MedBEAA
  Comment: if u use based on the first two points consumption is 40kg/min which even gets the result more further than 3212

- Name: Gibon3m
  Comment: @shoks that is surprising indeed. especially that, in my oppinion, calculating fuel flow with distance is not a correct method.
I just can't understand why it is "the closest" option in 99% of questions.
- Name: Breandawg
  Comment: FFS why don't they list the actual correct answer.
- Name: HaraldJeffler
  Comment: @Jimmy the fuel 5990 is the remaining fuel overhead OKEPI. However to get the average fuel flow we do not need to add the 4 minutes from that line as we are already there.
- Name: Jimmy
  Comment: Why do we use the actual fuel remaining of 5990 but then don't incorporate the time from that line 004 into our calculations
- Name: SHOKS
  Comment: There are two ways to calculate this
1. As per explaination given. Ie by adding time and finding fuel flow answer is 3182 kg
2. Other method is adding distance and calculating fuel consumed per unit distance Answer is 3241 kg

Surprisingly and rightly so, the average of the two methods is exactly 3212. !!l!

- Name: GPort1524
  Comment: Using CRP-5 (pretty quick, less to remember!):

1400 lb - 350 lb = 1050 lb

Use 10.5 (1050 lb) on inner scale and align with Sp.G of 0.78
Read off Imp. Gal value of 13.5 (135 Imperial Gallons) on inner scale

135 / 40 = 3.375 --> 4 drums
- Name: PilotFio11

- Name: A350WBX
  Comment: Works for all type of questions like this one:
1400-350=1050
40*10*0.78=312
1050/312=3.3653..= 4drums.
- Name: eugenege
  Comment: But we cant use all 4 right? Because our tank capacity will be exceeded
- Name: DoubleA
  Comment: an easy way to remember between imperial to Lbs you multiply SG by 10 , from Lbs to Imp you divide it so ,1050/10/.78 or 1050/(10x .78) =134.6 Imp so divide by40 drums , 134.6/40=3.36 so 4 barrels.
Kgs->lbs =X2.2
Ltrs->Kgs= X SG
Imp->Ltrs= X 4.546
Imp->US= X 1.2
Imp->lbs= 10XSG

  Comment: 1400 - 350 = 1050lb
1 us gal = 6 lb
1050/6 = 175 us gal

1imp gal = 1.2 us gal
175/1.2 = 145.8 imp gal --> 4 drums
- Name: BorgirBaka
  Comment: @Future Because you need to fill the plane up. If you buy 3 drums, it will not be 100% full. So you will need 4 drums to fill the plane p - the fact that there will be almost 3/4 drum you will pay for but not use will have to be ignored.

  Comment: 1400-350=1050
1050/2,2= 477
477/4,54=105
105/0,78=134,77
134,77/40= 3,36 ( as we can see- a bit more than 3 so the answer is 4)
Keep pushing y’all
- Name: Fran99
  Comment: 40 Imp Gal * 4.546 * 0.78 * 2.205 = 312.75 lb
1400 - 350 = 1050 lb
1050 / 312.75 = 3.36 fuel drums, so the aeroplane needs 3 because 4 doesn't fit in the tank, no?
- Name: PilotNatan
  Comment: 1400 lb - 350 lb = 1050lb of fuel required.
1 imp gal of fuel = 8 lb
1050 : 8 =131.25 Imp gallons.

131.25 Imp gallons required divided to 40 (fuel drums) = 3.28.

We need to order at least 4 Fuel Drums.

- Name: Nico123
  Comment: Let me clarify:
They want to know, which of the routes GIVEN is a SID from runway 10. If you go through the four possible answers only one will fit with runway 10 (MITOS 2A).
For your informaiton: On EVERY chart given there would be SIDs from runway 10, but these are not available options, between which you should choose..

  Comment: Similar appeard in Swedish CAA, however it stated that the aircraft is equipped with P-RNAV and was departing towards the North East Departure RWY10. They provided Plate 10-3E and 10-3C asking for the the SID to be used. A - Mitos 2A. B - Mitos 1C. C. Sopet 1F. D - Sopet 1G. I'm sure of option A and B, but logically I figured that the other 2 options should be from plate 10-3E.

Restu 3A is runway 10. Restu 1B is runway 28. Your option on the question is Restu 1B so is not runway 10. Checking the other one you will see that only on 10-3C Mitos 2A correspond to runway 10. You are welcome.

- Name: Marco85
  Comment: The explanation isn’t straightforward.

All runways has SID but that is not the question, the question is specifically asking RWY 10, so let’s see the answers:
Compare the answers with the charts.

Does CANTON 2C refer to runway 10? No, it refers to RWY 28
MAGAL 2D ?- RWY 28
RETSBU 1B ?- RWY 28
MITOS 2A? - Yes, MITOS 2A refers to RWY 10

RESTU 1B is for rwy 28 => wrong

- Name: CristianoRonaldo
  Comment: An RNAV overlay is a satellite-based procedure that follows the exact same track as a conventional route (like a VOR or NDB SID/STAR), but allows aircraft with GNSS/RNAV capability to fly it without using ground-based navaids.

Its not a new route, just a new way to fly the old one.
Same path, but flown using GPS/RNAV instead of radio beacons.
Helps modern aircraft reduce workload and improve accuracy.
- Name: Gregoire
  Comment: Seen in France 01/07/25. Some answers were different and I chose to answer not the one indicated as the correct answer proposed here wasn't present. We are not able to have feedback in France so I wouldn't be able to know if I chose the right one or not...
Answer that I chose: It can be flown using conventional navigation only
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Gregoire, thanks for the feedback! Just to confirm, the plate provided was the same? Thank you!
- Name: tompilot
  Comment: But the plate says you need to be BRNAV approved to fly the STAR. So why is conventional navigation also possible ? It contradicts what the plate says.
- Name: Chrieuse
  Comment: This cannot be performed with conventional navigation, it requires RNAV 5 approval and an RNAV system onboard. Whether the navigation is then achieved integrating VOR/DME information is another story, but that does not mean that this can be flown with conventional navigation.
- Name: Wiberus
  Comment: Answer C is literaly a hint for answer A, but the word 'only' in C makes obviously no sense :-)
- Name: TiagoOurSilva
  Comment: Correct Answer is: It can be flown using conventional navigation and RNAV. Here is the tricky part conventional navigation AND RNAV not OR
It does not state it can be flown using conventional only which is also not correct
Should be appealed as the other option is the counter positive of the affirmative. 2 correct answers looks like.
- Name: Evelina
  Comment: In the similar question No: 339528 stated that you can NOT fly conventional STAR if your STAR required B-RNAV :[
and on that chart in 339528 were also given radials beside the fact they called it RNAV STAR
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Evelina, thank you for your comment. In question 339528, the phrase "B-RNAV equipment MANDATORY" is specified clearly. As we stated in the explanation, if GERVU 1M was exclusively RNAV, it would be explicitly labeled as "RNAV," and there would be no radials or distances specified for the RNAV waypoints. In addition, if GERVU 1M was exclusively RNAV, it would also be stated that RNAV equipment is mandatory.

I answered 2. but was not 100% sure AND I appealed because it stated in the chart that BRNAV approval is required!! I don't know if I was correct or not

keep pushing
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: This gotta be appealed. If i have conventional nav and i am not RNAV equipped i cannot fly this procedure. It also requires approval so even if i consider the answer imprecise but correct, it still is partially wrong, cause without approval i still cannot fly it even if RNAV equipped.

The answer should state something like: it requires BRNAV approval to avoid confusion. SMH three questions in a row in which atplq also says that feedback is not verified or that we should appeal. Unbelievable

- Name: boyerj6
  Comment: I had this question today in Spain. The wording of the answer was different but with the same logic. It mentioned being an RNAV route, and being able to fly with both RNAV and conventional instruments.
- Name: BarkingEagle
  Comment: Is the correct answer actually confirmed? Yes, the Waypoints are somewhat defined by radials and distances from ground-based navaids. But "conventional navigation" would also mean that you can follow the STAR by following radials or DME arcs and that is not the case here. You could identify your position when directly overhead a waypoint but you certainly can't fly the procedure with conventional instruments alone as the procedure requires "random" routings between the waypoints. RNAV is not equivalent to GNSS. RNAV could also mean, flying random direct routings between points defined by radials and distances using a position estimate based on e.g. DME/DME. So for this STAR you definitely need RNAV and conventional navigation is not sufficient.
- Name: nikopuertorico
  Comment: POLAND SAME, same question but slightly diffrent two answers. Answer A was rewored and was written "It can be flown also with conventional navigation". I've chosen A but it was incorrect and answer B was written like: "Its route is based on GPS [..] as RNAV navigation route"
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello @nikopuertorico, we appreciate your feedback! It's indeed puzzling. GERVU 1M can be navigated using conventional instruments since all waypoints are identifiable.

  Comment: uk caa 30-1-24 seen longer reworded answers but with same idea
- Name: JeanMarc
  Comment: I believe BGS..

answer: can be flown using conventional instruments and RNAV.

explanation: this plate indicates that BRNAV approval is required to use the GERVU 1M and that can be achieved by DME/DME, VOR/DME and or GNSS inputs; the accuracy required is +/- 5NM on 95% of occasions. If the app is purely RNAV then it will state RNAV and there will not be radials and distances written against the RNAV points

Your answer for fuel shows 300kg but the airfield elevation is 2000ft which, according to the table, requires an adjustment of -50kg making the correct fuel value 250kg. Please correct (unless I'm missing something!)

  Comment: Why is 300 kg written to the fuel in the explanation? I know, this question is not about fuel I would just like to understand. According to the table 250 kg needs for the climb to 6000 feet minus the correction, since the AD is at 2000 ft elevation, so I would say 200 kg would be needed for this climb. Is that correct?
- Name: Richard
  Comment: For these charts don't do anything to the final altitude that you climb to > don't subtract elevation or something.
Only stuff that you interpolate is between flight levels and masses, etc.
Make sure to make adjustments in the end for fuel (this is only where the elevation comes into play)

The speeds, distances etc in the chart are already averaged (its an integrated value table) so you DO NOT have to take
the values for 2/3 climb or 1/2 descent.

- Name: Traciapello
  Comment: From the cruise distance you need a time. This is a time that you fly according to the real distance between the aerodromes which is constant. For instance when you are flying to Heathrow and your alternate is Stanstead you the distance between those airports is constant. So you want to know how much time you need to get to your alternate so you must know how much time it takes to fly from Heathrow to Stanstead considering the wind. So you need the groundspeed.

4) Alternate
(i) include: fuel, which should:

(A) fuel for a missed approach from the applicable DA/H or MDA/H at the destination aerodrome to missed approach altitude, taking into account the complete missed approach procedure;
(B) fuel for climb from missed approach altitude to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing;
(C) fuel for cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing;
(D) fuel for descent from top of descent to the point where the approach is initiated, taking into account the expected arrival procedure; and
(E) fuel for executing an approach and landing at the destination alternate aerodrome;

  Comment: Still doesn't make any sense ( like atpl easa doesn't ..but anyway) .. If we say increased fuel consumption due to increased weight, it means that for that trip, a certain amount of fuel flow will be that fuel flow for the trip.. So wouldn't be wise and make sense to calculate the trip fuel by the estimated fuel consuption given the forecasted conditions? Why is it extra fuel, if that wil be the fuel consuption for the trip ??

  Comment: @ThrusTruster
Thank you very much. The reason I asked is because I knew there would be a question that would ask for the NGM difference. Low ad behold I encountered one yesterday and had no idea how to do it. Appreciate it and good luck.
- Name: ThrustTruster
  Comment: @SufferingYou start by extracting the two values for 50k and 49k out of the table to get the NAM change in 1000kg.
NAM(50.000) = 3356
NAM(49.000) = 3157
Subtract 49 from 50, which gives you 199 NAM and then simply apply the formula you mentioned with TAS 424, TWC1 45kt, TWC2 65kt. You calculate it for both "wind settings" and will get approx. 229 NGM and 220 NGM.
- Name: SufferingATPL
  Comment: I know the question is asking for NAM but how are some people doing calculations and getting +9 to NGM
What are you doing to get that?
Because the only way I know to get NGM is by doing NAM x GS / TAS and I'm not getting anything near 9

  Comment: This is one of those deliberate contentious BS questions that is designed as click bait. Its a pointless and ruthless attitude of the examiner, and I will never understand this philosophy. Here is my take on this. Not suggesting its correct, but it seems to be the pedantic BS they are looking for;

"NDB CF identifier changes to "ASM" at 09:00 UTC, and changes back to "CF" after 00:00 UTC."

The reason this answer is incorrect, making the correct answer factually correct, is because it states AFTER 00:00 the NBD changes back to NDB CF. However, it is not after 00:00, it is exactly at 00:00 at it states FROM 00:00

"NDB REMAINS CF 367KHZ FROM 0000 TO 0900 NDB"

As said, it seems a deliberately malicious question, but I believe this is what validates the correct answer.

  Comment: Hey guys! On behalf of the Captain, the decision to take extra fuel will aim, in most cases, to obtain some extra time of holding at destination, especially when delays are expected, or if weather might be an issue for landing (low visibility, high crosswinds, etc). Another reason to carry extra fuel may be for en-route weather deviation.
Contingency fuel is the fuel to compensate for any unforeseen circumstances during the trip.

Close but still?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @KeepGoing the conversion from CAS to TAS, adding 2% of CAS per 1000 ft, is a rule of thumb and is recommended when the temperature conditions are not known. With this rule of thumb, only the effect of the altitude is taken into account and not the effect of temperature. Thus, the desired result cannot be assured.

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @CharlieBravo, thank you for your comment. We have rechecked our explanations and we can find nothing wrong with them. We believe there may be an inaccuracy in your calculations. Because even if you take a value between 5 degrees and 10 degrees for the temperature (including these) and align it with pressure altitude, the TAS value you get will be between 138.5 kt and 140 kt. Please recheck your calculations.
- Name: CaptainChris
  Comment: What is this? The A/C starts to descent between Chiemsee Island and Seeshaupt. So how can we a) only take into account the new height with the conditions between those two waypoints and b) assume that at FL45 there is exactly the same wind as at FL85? So b) is not a problem for me since there is no other cue. But for a) I think we have to consider that we are descending and therefore we need the average value between those two flight levels which is an interpolation of FL85 and FL45. For descent we use 50% of the height difference. So we effectively calculate the values at FL65 which would result in the same wind as FL85 and a TAS of 132,5 knots which will result in a GS of 132 knots. It will give an ETE of 20 mins 27 secs. I recognize this is not an exact answer here but who knows the rounding in the background? But how can the correct answer just be concerned about a flight between those two waypoints at the constant value of the new FL which is not yet reached?

There were 2 annexes: 1 was a map and the other one was similar to the one in the question but 2 the middle sectors (lets say for example Chiemsee-seeshaupt and seeshaupt- tall mast) didnt have info about time and distance- they were blank,
Got a question to calculate total distance and time from beginning to the end (lowz-ednl in this case) knowing that previous sectors have the same ground speed etc
I was so confused and lost a couple of minutes because I didnt open the 2nd annex (the map one) which is crucial because on the map you need to find this points, measure distance between them and calculate time from it. (Q worth 2 or 3? points)

I spent a while looking for a lower level wind but I admitted defeat and went for the 300/25 as forecasted (which I believe to be wrong!), and it worked. EASA genus once again!

Above 5000ft => 2000ft

Definition of MOCA, according to EASA AIR OPS.
If the terrain is equal to:
Below 6000ft => 1000ft
Above 6000ft => 2000ft

Definition of MOCA, according to ICAO Annex 2:
Within 8km radius => 1000ft
Within 8km & above high terrain* => 2000ft

  Comment: Got this question in Norway today but answers were differnt set up.
Was set up like this.

1500 ft - 5000 - 2000

1000 ft - 5000 - 2000

Always 1000ft

Always 2000ft

  Comment: In the explanation of question 335794 you say that for the primary area the MOC is 1000 ft / 300 m. It's opposite and confusing with the wording of this question.
- Name: Matthieu
  Comment: After investigation I found that MOC and MOCA are DIFFERENT

ICAO 8168 Does Defines MOC only (NOT MOCA)
EASA Air Ops Does define MOCA only (NOT MOc)

easa air ops:
(i) moca is the sum of:
(a) the maximum terrain or obstacle elevation, whichever is higher; plus
(b)1 000 ft for elevation up to and including 6 000 ft; or
(c)2 000 ft for elevation exceeding 6 000 ft rounded up to the next 100 ft.
(ii)the lowest moca to be indicated is 2 000 ft.

icao 8168:
the moc value to be applied in the primary area for the en-route phase of an ifr flight is 300 m (1 000 ft)
in mountainous areas, this shall be increased depending on: variation in terrain elevation:
between 900 m (3 000 ft) and 1 500 m (5 000 ft) moc = 450 m (1 476 ft)
greater than 1 500 m (5 000 ft) moc=600 m (1 969 ft)
- Name: Marco
  Comment: credits to @Antoniorosado, this comment is from another question but i suppose it can help a lot,

MOCA (minimum obstacle clearance altitude) is the minimum altitude for a defined segment that provides the required obstacle clearance (suffix T, EXAMPLE 3500T)

MOCA is the sum of maximum terrain or obstacle elevation, the higher, plus:

Terrain elevation Up to 3000 ft: MOCA = + 300 m (1000ft)
Terrain elevation 3000 - 5000 ft: MOCA = + 450 m (1500ft)
Terrain elevation Over 5000 ft: MOCA = + 600 m (2000ft)

ROUNDED TO THE NEXt 100ft!!

1500 m = 4 920 ft rounded to the next 100 ft is 5000 ft so 600 m (2000ft)
good luck to all!

flight altitude established by the State whose territory is overflown, or, where no such minimum
flight altitude has been established:
(1) over high terrain or in mountainous areas, at a level which is at least 600 m (2 000 ft)
above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft;

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Razvan, our explanation is taken from ICAO Doc 8168, 1.4 OBSTACLE CLEARANCE
The minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) value to be applied in the primary area for the en-route phase of an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight is 300 m (1 000 ft). In mountainous areas, this shall be increased depending on the variation in terrain elevation as follows:
Variation in terrain elevation
Between 900 m (3 000 ft) and 1 500 m (5 000 ft) ⇒ 450 m (1 476 ft)
Greater than 1 500 m (5 000 ft) ⇒ 600 m (1 969 ft)

  Comment: @ LUCA8927
If you take a look under the 3 possible FL you can choose on the figure, you can see the standard TAT which in this case is (-32*C), when the they tell you that the TAT is -17*C, then you must find the difference between these two --> (-17*C)-(-32*C)=+15*C
That means it's 15*C warmer that the standard TAT, because a lower temperature like -32*C is much colder than -17*C.
I hope it makes sense ;-)

  Comment: CDR - A Conditional Route (CDR) is a predefined air route that is not always available, but can be used under certain conditions usually depending on time, military airspace use, or traffic levels.

Types of CDRs:
CDR 1 Plannable routes (can be filed in flight plans)
CDR 2 Not plannable but can be re-routed by ATC
CDR 3 Permanently available routes (used routinely)

A CDR is a route you can use conditionally when airspace availability allows it. It helps improve flight efficiency and reduce congestion.

  Comment: Hi @CharlieBravo. The statements in the explanation belong to this question and are correct. The graph shows the result in NM, not NAM, but it is reported that the unit used in the options in the official exams is NAM, not NM. Therefore, since there is no information about the direction and velocity of the wind in the question, assuming that it is calm, the NM will be equal to the NAM. Thank you for your comment.

- Name: TheMert
  Comment: 4600 is clearly logical we lose everything, even our sight, so we choose the safest height. Sure, it might feel nice to choose 3300 and tell everyone how well you read the map, but the moment you enter the wrong sector without knowing or seeing, things will get dirty really fast
- Name: agusbin
  Comment: I hate to defend EASA, but contrary to most of these comments, this answer makes sense to me as a 737 FO. A major electrical failure causing loss of all NAV instruments is not a walk in the park.. In scenarios like this you need to prioritize and take issues away from you not add up things to worry about. In case of doubt of position, what is the cost of climbing 1000 ft more in comparison to crashing against a hill or obstacle? Those specific altitudes are for normal conditions when you are certain about your position, but if in doubt, I always consider the most conservative altitude. I would love to see people criticizing this answer to fly with the standby compass only and being unnecessarily precise flying lower altitudes ;).
- Name: FlyMax1993

- Name: Slyuosmaz

That's why people, including me, do not agree with the examiners on this answer.

- Name: 777umaid
  Comment: Once you have been cleared for 4000 assume MSA to be more on failure .
In the top right MSA circle based on your heading the 3300 ft is your MSA in normal situation, but you should be higher due to the failure so 4600 is more restrictive and it is the highest around the airport as well .

at least this way I convince myself .
- Name: ThrustTruster

The question asking two scenario wording in real exam probably is more clear

1) asking what is additional fuel if we dont have alternate fuel and using isolated destinations procedures which is 2 hours cruise fuel

2) asking what additional fuel if we selected alternate destination based on reduced contingency which is 30min at holding fuel : 2400 * 30min = 1200

Note: remember based on both procedures final reserve included in additional fuel.

  Comment: @clivebailey thanks so much for the feedback!
I have a quick question, did you minus the final reserve from your 2hr cruise alternate figure (5698) or did u just put it down like that? I was under impression you would need to deduct final reserve?
- Name: CliveBailey
  Comment: UK CAA today double type in, asking for both additional fuels. I put 5698 and 1200
- Name: PaulVlad
  Comment: guys guys guys..

Do not get tricked! Yes the highest ADDITIONAL FUEL (2h) we carry for the Destination. Perfect indeed!

But the question basically asks to calculate the ADDITIONAL for the longest trip, which is via ALTERNATE. Because we have that alternate as PDP, we use only 30 MIN.

They do not ask which is the highest additional!
The shortest trip requires the most additional because you are committed to destination and need a lot of extra safety margin.
The longest trip requires less additional. (thats the whole point of a pdp.)

1. Dept to dest via PNR, FUEL = 16726 (ADD 2HRS) = 21526
2. Dept to Alternate via PNR, FUEL= 21450 (ADD 30MINS) =22650
Choose greatest. Option 2 in this case where we use 30mins in hold which is 1200.

- Name: Alexander
  Comment: shortcut:
left side = flight to dest (with isolated aerodrome procedure applicable)
right side = flight to altn (normal 30min holding fuel flow)

=> calc both values = right side is the greater fuel required, so we use the finres of the right side = 1200kg
- Name: XavierNP
  Comment: The Isolated aerodrome procedure is the same as the PDP. Nothing to do with the ERA here.
You take the bigger of:
1. Dest: Taxi + Trip + Contingency + Additional fuel = 2h cruising speed for jets including but can't be less than Final Reserve + Extra fuel
2. Alt: Taxi + Trip + Contingency + Additional fuel = 30 min holding 1500 ft for jets including but can't be less than Final Reserve + Extra Fuel

So here for jets with the annex:
1. Dest: Taxi + Trip + Cont = 16926
Additional fuel = 2 hours at cruise consumption = 2*2849 = 5698
Total Dest 22 624
2. Alt: Taxi + Trip + Cont = 21650
Additional fuel = 30 min holding at 1500 ft = 2400 / 2 = 1200
Total Alt 22 850

Biggest number following the rules is going via PDP to alternate. Our additional fuel in our alternate calculation is 1200 kg or 30 min holding

*For reciprocating additional fuel 1. Dest: less of a) 45 min + 15% trip at cruise level or b) 2 hours at cruise level
2. Alt: 45 min of flight

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Majid, as you can see in the explanation:
Isolated aerodrome procedure
If the operator’s fuel policy includes planning to an isolated aerodrome, the last possible point of diversion to any available en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome should be used as the Pre-Determined Point.

Question Number: AT00188
- Name: CaptainMarius
  Comment: 1. Basic Designators (Non-RNAV Routes):
• Routes with the designators A, B, G, and R are traditional ATS routes that are not classified as RNAV (i.e., they rely on conventional navigation aids like VOR, NDB, etc.).
• Example: G869 is a non-RNAV route because its designator “G” falls under this category.
2. Suffix “R” (RNAV Route When Not Identified by the Designator):
• When an ATS route that normally isn’t RNAV (e.g., a “G” route) is implemented as an RNAV route, it is followed by the letter “R” to indicate that RNAV procedures apply.
• This happens when an RNAV version of the route exists, but the primary designator (A, B, G, R) doesn’t inherently indicate RNAV.
• Example: G869R (if it existed) would indicate that while “G869” is traditionally a non-RNAV route, this specific segment is operated as an RNAV route.

Why This System Exists:
• Legacy Routes: Many ATS routes were established before RNAV became widespread, so their original designations remain.
• Mixed Operations: Some airspace structures still support both conventional navigation and RNAV, so differentiating the two is necessary.
• Standardization: ICAO and EASA have chosen this method to avoid redefining entire route structures while allowing RNAV to be incorporated.

In summary, a route with “G” is non-RNAV, but “G…R” means it follows RNAV procedures, even though its base designator traditionally does not.

  Comment: Hi @CharlieBravo, thank you for your comment. The information you have provided is correct. However, the letter that is the subject of this question is not the letter in the "basic designator". Therefore, the meanings of the letters in your comment are only valid if they are the first letter of the ATS route.
When used as a route suffix, it means "RNAV route when not identified by designator". Please check "Jeppesen Introduction, Enroute pages 6-7". You will be able to see it visually and read what it means there.

Question Number: AT00189
- Name: intleverywhere
  Comment: Okay, this is how I solved this question.

Lets first find what was planned.

Time from SOPET to TORDU -> 39 + 14 = 53 minutes
With, 360kg - 241kg = 119kg planned fuel burn
With this information, we can how find the planned fuel flow: (119kg / 53 mins) x 60 = 135 kg/hr

Okay, so now lets find the fuel remaining at 19:42 at TORDU, as the question asks.
19:42 - 18:52 = 50 mins (use the sexagesimal function/format on your calculator to make this easier)
Now, (135 kg/hr x 53 minutes) / 60 = 112.5kg, this is the actual fuel burn.

Lastly, we take the fuel check from the start -> 375kg - 112.5kg = 262.5 kg -> rounded to 263kg

Good luck everyone !! :))

  Comment: You were planned to fly 53 mins and burn 119 kgs of fuel to TORDU
It only took you 50 mins and burnt 112 kgs of fluel (119 kg x 50 mins / 53 mins = 112 kg);
375 kg actual at toc - 112 kg burnt = 263 kg at TORDU
- Name: ErinSal
  Comment: Fuel Planned to burn from TOC to TORDU: 360 kg — 241 kg = 119 kg
ETO burning fuel above: 53 min
ATO: 50 min

If we burnt:
53 min = 119 kg
50 min = ? kg

50 x 119 / 53 = we actually burnt ~ 112 kg

Fuel Check 375 — 112 = 263 kg remaining at TORDU

TORDU with 2 figures in Fuel Check column -> 5kg/h higher

  Comment: This truly pisses me off. I've spent 2 days wondering what was really being asked and I thought it was a tough question that I couldn't be able to answer by myself, and after reading over 100 times the question I finally got it and couldn't believe that the wording was this bad and confusing for such a simple thing to do.
- Name: HadiK
  Comment: Nothing complicated here, only the wording is bad. Here is the process:
The question says burn is as expected, so from 360 planned to 241 in 53 min is the same as from 375.
Now 360 to 241 we burn 119 in 53 min (ETO)
The trip actually takes us 50 min (ATO), and so doing a proportion we burn 112.2. Kgs. Subtract that from 375 (actual) and you get 263.
- Name: Dieter14
  Comment: Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and memorize this one too
- Name: fra11crack
  Comment: The trick is to not mix Planned calculations with Actual calculations

1) FF must be calculated from Planned data (Planned fuel remaining and ETO).
2) As the question specifies it does not change, we can assume that the Planned FF is equal to the Actual FF.
3) Fuel burned can be calculated with Actual FF and ATO.

- Name: Gianluca
  Comment: Try to visualize like this:

The engines are running always at the same %, so they are burning always 135 kg/h as planned, BUT we are flying with a stronger tailwind than predicted.

That means our engines will always burn 135 kg/h, but as we have a higher Groundspeed, we will arrive earlier and the amount of fuel burnt will be less.

If you are flying 50 minutes instead of 53 minutes you are going to burn less fuel if fuel consumption is the same.

  Comment: ETO : 0.889 --> 53Min/60= 0.889[hr]
Planned fuel remaining = 360- 241 = 119[Kg]
So..
we got the FF= 119/0.889= 134.767 [Kg/ Hour].
Step 2) and the ATO = 50 min
134.767 * 0.833(50 Min)= 112.455 [Kg]

soo.. we have fuel check of 375 KG, And we bourn 112 Kg of fuel so far.
375-112 = 263 [Kg]

hope this help took me same time to get this.

  Comment: Fuel flow is as planned okay so :
As planned fuel flow is 135kgs per hour
They don't say that the time of flight is as planned and it is asked for the fuel remaining at 19:42 not 19:53

So : 135kgs per hour means in 50min ( actual flight time ) we will burn 112,5 kgs of fuel.
375kgs minus 112,5kgs = 262,5kgs --> 263kgs
Can you confirm that 256kgs is the expected answer ?

  Comment: here too, you are confusing terms and formulas. The pressure correction is between Indicated and pressure altitude. The true altitude is 8011 ft, but since there is no mention of any ISA deviation, we can assume that true altitude = indicated. So indicated will be 8011 ft. And this has to be pressure corrected to obtain PA. So PA=8701. What a mess!

Now, if you are doing temperature correction in order to find Flight Level ( Pressure Altitude ) you will ADD when temp is COLDER than ISA and you will SUBTRACT when WARMER than isa

If you are looking for true altitude you will just add when warmer than isa and subtract when colder than isa.

Hope that makes sense and helps :)

  Comment: Without calculation: We can eliminate A and D because for an IFR flight the FL ends with a 0. We can eliminate B because for a westerly track, the FL has an even digit in the ten's position. C (FL 60) is the only remaining answer.

--> 3 / 200 = 0.015
Result: 3 + 0.015 = 3.015

- Name: nLighten
  Comment: why do we 138.8 NAM * 3 kg/NAM since we already have other TAS?
SFC would also change I went through this in the other way (and didn't got correct answer). just tell me where i'm wrong:

before weather update:
tas 120
gs 125
time 1.2h
144 nam * 3 kg/nam = 432 kg
>>>fuel flow = 432/1.2 = 360 l/h<<<

after weather update:
tas 124
gs 134
time 1.12h
138.8 nam
>>>360 l/h + 0.5% = 361.8 l/h<<<

361.8*1.12 = 405 l
so the difference is 432-405 which is much more than in the answer

- Name: XavierNP
  Comment: 1) Calculate initial fuel consumption:
GS1 = 120 + 5 = 125, NAM1 = (NGM1 * TAS1) / (GS1) = (150*120)/125 = 144
3 kg / NAM => 144*3 = 432 kg
2) Calculate new TAS due to temperature increase, 2 kts / 5C => 4 kts increase
TAS2 = 120 + 4 = 124 kts
3) Find new GS with new TAS and wind increase and deduce new NAM and fuel consumption
GS2 = TAS2 + 10 = 124 + 10 = 134 kts
NAM2 = (NGM * TAS2) / (GS2) = (150 * 124) / (134) = 138.8
3 kg/Nam => 138.8*3 = 416.4 kg
4) correct for temperature increase
0.5 % / 10c => (0.5/100)*416.4 + 416.4 = 418.5 [also equal to 1.005*416.4]
5) find the difference
432 - 418.5 = 13.5 kg decrease

so think on the wording of a question,

change in OAT is 10 degrees higher,

so it means before this change, there is no temp deviation.

  Comment: Am I the only one that was so traumatised from being mislead, thus calculating each blank Time field with the GS and Distance?
- Name: AndyT
  Comment: This is a deceptively easy question and really takes about 5 seconds once you realise.
The question asks for 'Planned' time not actual time.
Line 1 of the plan says Take Off at 1300 hrs.
Last line of the plan says ETA 13:57 hrs
So answer is 57 mins!
- Name: klappan
  Comment: PLANNED total time.
- Name: samiturk8
  Comment: Took a second look but here:
Asking for planned time, so my best guess is we're considering ETA ONLY not actual.
ETA at 1305, and that first leg takes 5 minutes. So we "depart" at 1300
Log says arrival ETA is 1357
Difference of 57 minutes
- Name: avilex

  Comment: @nunxuc thank you
- Name: nunxuc
  Comment: @ NicoH yes it works.
The application of your formula would be 35=X*(190/60) for LIBLO to BTA then solve for X--> 35/(190/60) X=11.05
The other approach is to write it out.
To get ETA for example of LIBO to BTA use:
190 nm --> 60min
35 nm --> x
To solve: (35 nm*60 min)/190 nm. This will give me the time it takes me to fly a distance of 35nm going at a speed of 190nm a hour. 11 min
Repeat this for the rest.

  Comment: Explanation is misleading. Don't calculate each point time, this question is a trap.

It asks for PLANNED flight time, so focus only on the ETA column. Subtract take-off time (on the upper part of the chart) from ETA at the last point:

13:57 - 13:00 = 57 minutes
- Name: Ralle400
  Comment: These kind of question must be answered always in different ways. This case the ATA in the third line, I thought it was a hint that the is slower than planned and calculated with the new parameters. Got 59 - decided for 57. But you get crazy of all these kind of questions.
- Name: Gianluca
  Comment: in the last leg 24/144 = 10 minutes, how is it possible the navlog has 13 minutes?

for the first 2 leg we have an actual time of arrival that can be used, but we can't use the 13 minutes as an input. instead 10 minutes should be used as the only data known to us are GS and distance
- Name: Nelli

  Comment: FFS! Where is the LO which states that 'know which flower is associated with a particular country'!??! The question simply refers to a reporting point somewhere on the chart called 'tulip'. There's no Lat/Long provided, so (luckily) an intuitive search within Dutch airspace found it. Im SOOOOO fed up with searching for needles in haystacks in this subject. Furthermore, it takes time to undertake said search. Strikes me this exam is all about beating the clock. The examiner sending us on wild goose chase for obscure info; in other words, a hurried (rushed) approach to flight planning - something that is totally contradictory to a safe (deliberate) approach to flying.

  Comment: TULIP = Amsterdam 125,75
- Name: zeymahse
  Comment: @CarloRomaFlyPe Explanation is pretty straightforward.
You are passing so imagine probably still at TULIP wp and following route P1.
If you look closely exactly where the P1 black arrow is, you'll se the green dashed line marking the boundary where the freq. change should take place. Now, the q. states that you changed the freq. by mistake, it was not supposed to be changed. What was the freq. you had before the mistake? This is basically the q. asking us. Since you are still on the southern side of the green dashed line, you proabably still were with Amsterdam 125.75Mhz and that's the correct asnwer. If you were passing MONIL wp, for example, you'd be on the north of the green dashed line and you'd be contacting Amsterdam 123.705 because you are the the OTHER side of the boundary.

  Comment: "you are passing a non compulsory reporting point called TULIP", so, in my understanding, we are OVERHEAD TULIP. Not after, not before, just overhead. This means you are still in the 125.75 frequency range. Thats all EASA wants here.

Be careful to read it correctly in that where you see "DA/MDA" they are grouped together and "(H)" is height

(H) = (702')

It doesn't help that the explanation has underlined DA only when the question obviously asks for MDA.

  Comment: I just saw a similar question today in Spain but little more complex. If I'm not wrong, it was something like:
VNAV capabilities of the aircraft are down and you can only use LNAV. Which of below is correct:
A 3D non-precision flight with guidance by ground augmentation.
B 2D non-precision flight WITHOUT guidance provided by on-board instruments.
C 3D non-precision flight WITHOUT guidance provided by on-board instruments.
D 2D non-precision flight with guidance by ground augmentation.
The wording/order may be slightly different or missing some precise words, but the main concept was that it was mixing, "WITHOUT", on-board equipment and augmentation systems. For sure that with your professional expertise, you guys can build a new question in this direction. Hope it helps.

The other number 66 nearby indicates the MORA (Minimum Off Route Altitude) for that section of the chart (grid MORA) is 6,600 ft, which only takes into account terrain clearance and no other items (such as radio aid reception or minimum procedure altitude), but for the whole area inside those grid lines. It is therefore different from the MEA.

  Comment: I had this at Austro heavily reworded, was something like this but I already miss many infos: You're flying from Alicante at FL330 and need to descend to 8000 feet following the VLC 2L. How far from the IAF do you need to commence your descend when your MEAN TAS is (xy, can't remeber sorry was 328 or similar) plus wind speeds and they also gave an avarage descend rate. Answers were pretty close 138NM, 139NM, 141 and maybe 142NM

  Comment: @Bernat I was thinking the same, that the answers can be paired together two and two and mean the same thing. But if you know which to are correct, then think about in which scenario we NEED to make the correction - when we are higher or lower than expected?
- Name: Benjamin
  Comment: Seen in Norway 11.23. ATPLH different, more wording. It was same question and 2 obvious flase answers. The other two went something like this,

- ISA or colder and correction added to the DH (pretty similar to AVEX and also what I picked, but was thrown off by stating ISA as then its no need for correction as it is 100%correct??)
- Much colder than ISA and correction is added to DH, MDH and any step down procedures. (Thought this sounded strange as "Much colder" seems to be false according to AVEX and im uncertain about the step downs??)

needless to say, I left a comment..
- Name: Berni
  Comment: Imo, this question should specify whether the temperature correction is to obtain:
-True Altitude (which we add to the DH) or;
- Indicated Altitude (which we subtract to the DH).

If not mentioned, there are 2 potential correct answers here!
Am I wrong or this question just lacks data?
- Name: Denys
  Comment: If EASA wanted us to learn smth they would put DA in answer instead of DH, cause DH is usually measured by RA during LVO and it's not affected by temperature but we got what we got

  Comment: cold is dangerous due to true alt being low to be sure we add the temp correction
- Name: Martin
  Comment: high to low, watch out below. So if it's a cold day, you really don't want to be too low on approach. So the DH will be higher accordingly.
- Name: Gabriel
  Comment: Seen Austro Vienna, but the options were different. I selected the correct option as much lower than ISA and corrections is added to step down fixes after FAF and to the DH/MDH.

- Name: TB20Sam
  Comment: This question is unanswerable as it is currently worded, as we don't know how much fuel was in the tanks at the start of the flight. The question writer presumably wants us to assume that we took off with just the planned trip fuel, but that would be an insane assumption to make as it would go against all the other rules we've learned about for fuel planning.

It needs to either say that we took off with only the planned trip fuel on board, or say that 46kg of the planned trip fuel remains in the tanks, plus reserves.

  Comment: @ ricardgalisteo thats cool and all but be doesnt run out of fuel. His actual consumption is 8kg/h less than the planned one. Meaning he still has fuel leftover when landing. I think he just got lucky this time tho. someone cannot plan a flight this badly
- Name: ricardgalisteo
  Comment: This novice runs out of fuel on the flare, I prefer to do so on the TOD. We are not the same.
- Name: Wiberus
  Comment: This question is very badly worded but maybe this will help:
1) Planned 220NM with 140KT, so total flight time is 1:34.
2) Planned fuel flow is 45kg/h -> 1:34 x 45kg = 70,7 kg (planned total fuel so thats what we had at take off)
3) 70,7kg - 46kg gives us 24,7 kg (burned in 40 minutes) -> 24,7 in 40 is equal to 37kg/h
4) 45kg/h (planned) minus 37kg/h (actual) gives us 8 kg/h less than planned

  Comment: "2.The Planned consumption for the 1.57 hr Flight time is: Flight time x Planned fuel flow = 1.57 hr x 45 kg/hr = 71 kg."
And now you forgot to count contingency, final reserve and additional fuel. Those examiners have to study fuel planning before flight monitoring..
- Name: RotorBoat
  Comment: a silly question, but this is how you approach it
step 1: find the initial fuel (find the time it takes to fly the route, then multiply it by the expected fuel flow)
step 2: find the fuel flow by finding difference in the initial fuel to the after 40 minutes, and convert that to fuel flow per hour
step 3: compare the actual fuel flow per hour to the expected fuel flow per hour

it's a ridiculous question, but unfortunately you need to remember and learn these assumptions to get throughs crap
hope i helped!

  Comment: according to explenations why we are not calculating fuel flow over whole route? because
Actual fuel consumed/h which is 37,5kg x 1*34* = 58,75
45kg/h x 1*34* = 70,5
70,5-58,75=11,75 so i would say it is 12liters less than planned.
Is it EASA trick or we have small fault?

  Comment: "An aircraft flying a distance of 220 nm with a ground speed of 140 kt"

5.1.2 Minimum levels
Except when necessary for take-off or landing, or except when specifically authorized by the appropriate authority, an IFR flight shall be flown at a level which is not below the minimum flight altitude established by the State whose territory is overflown, or, where no such minimum flight altitude has been established:
a) over high terrain or in mountainous areas, at a level which is at least 600 m (2 000 ft) above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft;
b) elsewhere than as specified in "a", at a level which is at least 300 m (1 000 ft) above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft.
I am also adding this statement in the explanation section to make it clearer. Thank you for your comment.

- Name: Hussam Razzaq Anbooree
  Comment: it is easy , follow my way

In general the formula of distance is ===> D = T × S………( time here should in hours)
In such questions, the time formula ====> T = different altitude OR FL ÷ Rat of descent ………( the time here in minutes we should convert to hours)

Now
D= ?
S= 135 kt
T = ?
T = 3500 ÷ 300 = 11.66 min convert ===> 11.66 ÷ 60 = 0.194 h
D = T × S ==> 0.194 × 135 = 26.19

  Comment: I solved it in different way

Allow takeoff mass is the lowest of RTOM or MLM + Trip
RTOM = 76000kg
MLM+Trip = 71121 (lowest)

Actual takeoff mass (to find TOM we take actual ZFM + TOF) = 66791kg
71121 - 66791 = 4330kg this is how much space left we have and we can use it to top some fuel.

4330kg is cool but what about the tank? Tank capacity - Block = 7760 (we have enough space for our 4330)
what about LM? is this exceed our MLM? MLM - LM = 4430 good.

Answer 4430kg
- Name: Jai
  Comment: SEEN UK CAA 27/04
- Name: diadros
  Comment: The steps for this kind of questions are:
1) check the limiting TOM by comparing the MTOM or RTOM ( like in this question) and MLM+Trip fuel => take the lowest of both.

2) take the resulting limiting mass from step 1 , and rest all operational masses ( DOM, Trafic load, required Fuel for the flight), the result will be your underload and potential extra fuel to be carried.

3) Double check if the total of extra fuel resulting from step 2 plus the required fuel doesn't exceed the tank capacity (normally it doesn't but always double check)

4) Double check if the new TOM ( with your extra fuel found in step 2 included) doesn't exceed the limiting RTOM or MTOM, you check this regardless if you took the MLM as your limiting mass to calculate the extra fuel.
It usually doesn't exceed it , but I believe there's one question out there that does. always double check!

cheers
- Name: Jack
  Comment: MLM + TF : 66360+4761 = 71121 (less than RTOM so we are MLM limited)
TOM - ZFM - BLOCK: 71121-59031-8000 = 4090
BUT taxi fuel (part of block) is not carried for takeoff, so add that 240 back on to give you the answer of 4330
- Name: Davide
  Comment: block fuel = 8000
TOF = 7760
LND FUEL = 2999
EXTRA FUEL = 66360 - 2999 - 59031 = 4330

(always check for max mass limitations, in this case it's LM limited)

  Comment: U can apply the correction to the FL85 or to the 2000ft, no difference. Just remember FL always means 1013, therefore if u wanna put the FL85 to 1030 you're gonna add. If u wanna put the 2000ft, u assume its at 1030QNH, so u wanna put it to 1013, therefore u SUBTRACT, regardless of which of these u decide to do the result will be the same. @FloZ99

- Name: omarr
  Comment: why is everyone talking about FL150, its FL85??
- Name: pepejr
  Comment: paul the answer should be 121 XD
- Name: hello545
  Comment: Simply convert the Flight Level to an equivalent Altitude, so 1030 - 1013 = 17 * 30 = 510ft, therfore we are at 16010ft Altitude (in ISA condition), we have to be overhead the VOR at 2000ft and so have to descent through 14010ft / 500 = 28.02min, 260 / 60 = 4.33 * 28.02 = 121.3nm
- Name: Bradjones
  Comment: If it takes 121nm to descend then why is the answer 120? You'll be above the required 2000' if decent starts at 120?
- Name: Sam
  Comment: 1030 - 1013 = 17 x 30 = 510ft (as you are winding this DOWN to ISA you will subtract this from the lower (aerodrome side))

2000 - 510 = 1490 above the VOR
15,500ft - 1490ft = descent of 14,010ft
14,010 / 500fpm = 28mins descent time
GS (same as TAS as there is no wind) / 60 = 4.3nm/min ........ x 28 = 121nm

Question Number: AT00213
- Name: McEvoy
  Comment: @FredTheRick thats exactly the comment I was going to leave. Completely agree. We should be told whether the weather warrants 2 alternates or whether 2 were just picked for fun. Changes how much fuel is RQD
- Name: FredTheRik
  Comment: Quote from regulation: "1) The flight shall be conducted so that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is not less than: (i) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel" What is the "required alternate fuel"? It is the HIGHER of the two alternate fuel quantities, if two alternates are required. I don't agree that with the information given we can just speculate that the flight requires just one alternate and the pilot picked a second one just for fun.
- Name: Gibon3m
  Comment: but we need to have 2 alternates for a reason (bad weather or no forecast). so isn't it mandatory to have alternate sufficient for the more distant alternate?
- Name: GinnY
  Comment: UK CAA this week, all wording and numbers correct.
- Name: AnuBoswell
  Comment: 3300 lbs is our takeoff fuel, we have 2300 left over in the tank after 400nm.
3300-2300 = 1000lbs burnt after 400nm. Distance to destination is: 800nm.
1000lb x 2 = 2000lbs

3300 - 2000lbs = 1300 lbs of fuel left over which is above final reserve of 600lbs, meaning we can make our destination and if we need to then we can go to our second alternate as that will use the least fuel!
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: the reason you are confused is because you have to assume that FF remais constant (even if it was different than the planned so there s something wrong and how can u assume it will stay constant..) and also that you dont calculate contingency.
so dont be upset. it is the question that sucks and that is poorly made. just move on and remember
- Name: chesl
  Comment: but what if increased fuel burn affect alternate fuel as well:)
- Name: JoaoD
  Comment: @Marceli ,if you are NOT REQUIRED by regulation to have 2 alternates THEN you can choose the alternate that requires less fuel.

This question is an example of that

If you were to choose the alternate which required 800 kg, then you would burst the final reserve by 100 kg if a diversion was needed
- Name: Kokoszka17
  Comment: I don't understand the reasoning behind the answer. The regulation quoted in the explanation states that a flight has to be planned in a way that the fuel remaining upon landing is not less than alternate fuel + final reserve fuel. Does this mean we can choose the closer alternate out of the 2 available so that the amount of alternate fuel is still within limits upon landing at our destination?
- Name: BobbieBrink
  Comment: Senasa 17/01 exact numbers
- Name: Hassib
  Comment: @ATPLQ How is it recommended to go for Alternate 2, while Operational Flight Plan will automatically calculate fuel for the longest Alternate (Alternate 1 in this case), in this specific scenario, we shall continue to destination and commit to land with final fuel reserve intact (if weather is above applicable minima) or we do inflight replanning. In no case we can consider Alternate 2 as our destination alternate as per current flight planning ,but if PIC decides he can do inflight replanning and nominate Alternate 2 as his/her Alternate.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hey @Hassib, as the correct answer states, the flight shall continue. Now the question is, in case of diversion shall the aircraft proceed to alternate 1 or 2? You can easily get to the correct answer by performing the following calculations:
According to the question text, after 400 NM: 3 300 lb - 2 300 lb = 1 000 lb of fuel was consumed.
If the aircraft travels for another 400 NM, arriving at the destination, it will have consumed another 1 000 lb (assuming all remains the same). Consequently, the fuel at the destination will be: 2 300 lb - 1 000 lb = 1 300 lb.
Alternate 1 fuel required: 800 lb. 1 300 lb - 800 lb = 500 lb (fuel remaining) ⇒ Arriving at alternate 1, the fuel remaining will be less than the final reserve fuel which is 600 lb.
Alternate 2 fuel required: 500 lb. 1 300 lb - 500 lb = 800 lb (fuel remaining) ⇒ Arriving at alternate 2, the fuel remaining will be more than the final reserve fuel which is 600 lb.
Hence the correct answer is "continue the flight; in case of diversion proceed to the Alternate 2."
I hope this makes sense!
- Name: StefanZ
  Comment: I can understand that's the only numbers we have to work with. Anyway, we already work on the assumption that the second half of the trip would consume the same amount of fuel as the first half did and don't account for any differences in fuel consumption for take off, climb, descent and approach. Makes it always a bit hard to figure out what the questions writer was really after to hear from us.
- Name: ina
  Comment: its easy guys , Remaining word is missleading,
its says total distance =800
travelled =400 with 1000lb-- (800-400=400 more to go so another 1000 lb )
Tof=3300 lb
trip=1000 +1000=2000 lb
left fuel =3300-2000=1300 lb

so to reach dest how much fuel we left with =1300lb which is enough to go to Alternate in case
- Name: Augustin
  Comment: Wouldnt it still burn more fuel from the destination to the alternate? You definitely will use the reserve fuel. Also the reason why we have 2 alternates is to have more options, if we cant go to alternate 1 then we dont have a choice.
- Name: Eltaweil
  Comment: Since 2300 remains at the Midway (400nm), so
Fuel Burn 3300-2300 = 1000 in 40nm. Thus, it will burn another 1000 for the next 400nm. so;
At Midway; 2300-1000= 1300 Total Fuel at Destination
1300-600 (Final Reserve)= 700
So, the remaining Fuel is not sufficient to reach Alternate-1 (800lb) in case of Diversion, thus Alternate-2(500lbs) will be considered.

Remember;
If we have two Alternate ADs, We consider only the greater Alternate Fuel in our calculations.
- Name: Davide
  Comment: as @ATPL QUESTIONS said it is all about the "most correct". Here it is true that when you load fuel you take the furthest of the alternates if 2 alternates are needed, but Easa never specifies that an emergency shall be declared if at any point along the route you find yourself with less alternate fuel than what was calculated. You should not load like this, but you can continue of course

Think the question like this:

If at anytime during the flight the PIC realises that the Fuel Flow is higher that what was initially calculated, in which case shall he/she declare and emergency?
A If the reviewed contingency fuel is below that initially planned
B If the reviewed trip fuel is below that initially planned
C If the reviewed alternate fuel is below that initially planned
D If the reviewed FINAL RESERVE FUEL is below that initially planned

What would you answer?

Of course you would be concerned, overall if a weather situation is tobe expected at destination or at the alternate you can still fly to, or among else if you couldn't reach any alternate at all, but you would not declare emergency unless finres is expected to be touched.. .

as usual.. tricky and bastard ;-)

  Comment: Wrong! You just declare emergency if you have less than final reserve fuel in the aerodrome you’re committed to land. It has no sense to declare en-route if you still have more than final reserve fuel over destination.

(i) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel; or
(ii) the final reserve fuel if no alternate aerodrome is req
(...)
3) The commander shall declare an emergency when the calculated usable fuel on landing, at the nearest adequate aerodrome where a safe landing can be performed, is less than final reserve fuel.

  Comment: does someone know why we have to learn the crp-5 if the answers are 50/50?
- Name: kotasz
  Comment: When the track is known, always use the WIND UP method on CRP5. So you mark the wind ABOVE the center line. and the track direction is set instead of heading. You will see, that you will get exactly 9 degrees drift to the right. The traditional "wind down" method is prone to errors due to its iterative nature. The wind up method in such cases provides bullet proof surgical precision.
- Name: philipkozlovv
  Comment: TAS = 171
Course = 127 (M) + 15 = 142 (T)
Crosswind component sin(142-110)*50 = sin (32) * 50 = 26,5kt
WCA = Crosswind component / (TAS/60) = 26,5 / (171/60) = 9.29 = 9

Hope it helps, I have noticed that its better to use trigonometry instead of CRP5 in Flight Planing

  Comment: the answer drift 9 right is correct
the question mentioned COURSE not HEADING
remember, for crp we always put it under TRUE HEADING
- not magnetic heading
- not magnetic track (course)
- not true track (course)

so after you get 12 degree right, you need to do the HEADING + DRIFT = TRACK to get the heading and turn your crp to the heading and you will get 9 drift to the right
- Name: Cucaklk
  Comment: Convert MT to TT with variation (142 TT)

now do wca formula: 142-110= 32. SEN(32)x50=26. 26x60= 1560. 1560/170 (TAS)= 9 WCA
Wind is coming from 110. so from h to t is drift. R drift.

  Comment: Hi @danipilot18. As we stated in the explanation;
When the question provides a track, mark wind velocity upwards from the center. When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center.
In this question, we find the true track value by adding the variation value to our course. So we mark the wind velocity upwards from the center. Thank you for your comment.

- Name: antoine
  Comment: Hi,

As I do not like computers for their pretty bad accuracy and error-prone usage, for those who want a fast mathematical method :

1) Convert MH to TH : 127(M) = 142(T)
2) Extract crosswind component : 50 x sin(32) = 26.5 kt
3) Find the TAS at FL70 ISA+10 in the table with extrapolation : 170.25 kt
4) Apply Speed Factor to crosswind : 26.5 x (60 / TAS) = 9.3 kt

Hope it helps,

357 and 310 depicted in the chart are NOT radials, but are the MT u have to follow to get TO the VOR.
So respectively, for 357, the radial FROM the vor will be 177 and for 310 the radial FROM the vor will be 130.
It is now clear that for 1700ft we have the range of radials that go from 177 clockwise to 130.

"GRID MINIMUM OFF-ROUTE ALTITUDE (Grid MORA) — An altitude derived by Jeppesen or provided by State Authorities. The Grid MORA altitude provides terrain and man-made structure clearance within the section outlined by latitude and longitude lines. MORA does not provide for navaid signal coverage or communication coverage."
SID/STAR-6 (Jeppesen introduction);
"Within to-scale areas grid MORAs will be depicted with latitude/longitude defining the applicable sector. Sectors are formed by 30 minutes or one degree of latitude and longitude.

It is created based on the highest elevation inside that grid
We dont have the info on where that obstacle is, but by looking at the MSA we can see that inside that 25NM arc there is no obstacle higher than the msa value, so we can ignore that Grid altitude because the obstacle isnt inside the 25nm radius

- Name: Bugti
  Comment: (At waypoint ZFP, the TAS will be 466 kts and flight level will remain at FL400.) is incorrect, this speed becomes of flight level change so the correct answer is FL 380 to FL400 ,

Question Number: AT00217
- Name: Gala03
  Comment: However in the total fuel is also considered the 300 lb taxi fuel that will be burnt during taxi. Since the maximum mass is at take off if we take 6500 at the start of the takeoff run we will have 300 lb available for extra fuel. So we could also add extra 300 lb and based in maximum takeoff mass should be 6800 lb and so became limiting the landing mass with maximum extra fuel 6600
- Name: Andrew1406
  Comment: Based MLM = 5500 lb
Based on MTOM = 6500

Both answer may be correct , however question ask for maximum .
- Name: SniperTheOne
  Comment: This actually kinda contradicts with one of the previous question where you could also add your taxi fuel, so you would leave the apron with more than MTOW but you would burn the taxi before actual take off.
- Name: FloZ99
  Comment: Ah, I think I got it..
Actually the MLM 5500 is correct but due to the additional penalty, which is 1100, it is 6600, so answer is 6500.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
- Name: Evelina
  Comment: in some questions they asking to find extra fuel including fuel penalty, now they ask just about extra fuel, but answer still with penalty
- Name: Martinezo110
  Comment: 6500 is correct otherwise u will exceed the max weight
- Name: TommyCigar
  Comment: disgusting filthy trap
- Name: Cyphlumer
  Comment: CORRECT Answer is 6500
Once you have calculated 6600 now recheck
6600+AZFM+Planned TOF = 56100
now we cannot exceed MTOM 56000 so we have to reduce 100, so total Extra Fuel is 6600-100 = 6500
- Name: Frank172
  Comment: i disagree, you cannot use 56000 of the MTOM because it exceed the 55000 of the MLM+ TRIP FUEL. The correct answer should be 5500 lb
- Name: GhaithGarraoui
  Comment: Logically, the extra fuel equation including the fuel penalty should be =
extra fuel - 200 * extra fuel/1000 = 5500 lb
(5500 lb being the maximum margin when it comes to the limiting MLM)
Different value but the correct answer is the same.
- Name: JoaoD
  Comment: @Eva, plz read the 10000 comments below that explain the correct answer

(Or just take in mind that our ATOM is 55000 kg, our ZFM is 34500 kg and our TOF is 15000, so just by that (and the fuel penalty) we can see that we "could" carry 6600 kg extra. Now we need to check if there is any restriction to that value. If we loaded 6600 kg we would surpass our MTOM by 100 kg, so we can only carry 6500 kg)
- Name: Andres
  Comment: Always remember to check whether or not the extra fuel will make you fall above your MTOM limit.
- Name: CompletedATPL
  Comment: This subject is like minefield
- Name: Ercan
  Comment: The MLM is in this case the limiting factor but you have to take into account that the extra fuel that you take will cause the engine to burn more fuel cause of the extra weight. This is why we take a fuel penalty to avoid that the engines use the extra fuel that we want to take with us. The aircraft will land at the extact MLM beacause that fuel penalty is burned due to that extra weight.
- Name: Marcelo
  Comment: - Calculate ZFM = DOM + Traffic Load = 34500
- Find fuel tank allowance (Tank Capacity - Ramp Fuel) = 11700
- Find takeoff allowance (MTOM - ZFM - TOF) = 6500
- Find landing allowance (MLM - ZFM - [ TOF - Trip Fuel ] ) = 5500

Landing has the lowest allowance possible.
Find penalty: (5500 / 1000) x 200 = 1100
Apply penalty: 5500 + 1100 = 6600
However, this will exceed the maximum takeoff allowance (6500) so that limit applies instead.
- Name: Niriarisina
  Comment: Is fuel penalty applied only for landing stuff ?
- Name: Daniel
  Comment: @Andrea But when you take penalty + extra fuel = 5500+1100 = 6600
If you take the TOM 49500 + 6600 =56100kg which is over the TOM..So the extra fuel is 56000kg - 49500= 6500kg.
- Name: Tariq
  Comment: at the end add all valued from DOM. 25,000 + 9,500 + 15,000 + 6,600 = 56,100.
since it is more than our MTOM by 100 we decrease by that amount hence the answer 6,500 not 6,600
- Name: Andrea
  Comment: this can't be correct. you should use MLM + Trip Fuel for you ATOM and then calculate the extra fuel using the fuel penalty. result should be 6600
- Name: Ahmed
  Comment: If you load it up with 6600 lb you will be overweight at t/o, which is why it becomes the limiting factor
- Name: Tristan
  Comment: @ATPLQ this is the process used in all other questions so why is it not correct here?:
MTOM = 56000
MLM = 45000 + 10000 trip fuel = 55000 <== THIS IS LIMITING THE TAKE OFF MASS!
55000-25000-9500-15000 = 5500 + fuel penalty (1100) = 6600.
- Name: Tristan
  Comment: @John I'm thinking the same, answer should be 6600 because MLM is limiting
- Name: John
  Comment: Why is the Max Take Off Mass not based on Landing Mass + Trip Fuel? This would make it the most restrictive at 55'000lb. If it's based on the MTOM of 56'000 we would be 1000lb above our landing mass. What am I doing wrong?
- Name: Mohammed
  Comment: the correct answer is 6600 lb

Question Number: AT00220
- Name: pilot320
  Comment: Guys I had this question in senasa Spain 11/7/25
The first option = Min 3100 ft at 9.5 NM from ALT
Max 220 kt until MITOS
Min 5000 ft at SUMMO ( this line didnt appear)
So it was a shorter just like answer C
Worth 2 points, I recommend not to have summo as reference for the ones that memorised:)

- Name: CaptainMarius
  Comment: Guys we are following departure Mitos 1c. The answer with min 5000 ft at Summo it does NOT apply to our departure. It applies to MITOS 2A. Also under the SUMMO you can read MITOS 2A 5000 FT
- Name: ASLCaptain2929
  Comment: No Summo wresltling allowed during the SID
- Name: Vitalii
  Comment: can you explain please why SUMMO 5000min is incorrect. Bcz its 5000 or Above ? If you check routing section on chart MITOS2C 28 , you will see there is summo and its restriction we should comply when flying. So why its not correct? Any feedbacks on this one at actual exam ? Thanks
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Vitalii. The correct SID for runway 28 is MITOS 1C. When MITOS 1C SID is examined, it is seen that there is no restriction on SUMMO.
Also, SUMMO is not the only thing to focus on in the wrong options, each of them contains instructions that do not comply with the MITOS 1C SID. Thank you for your comment.
- Name: IcebergFINISHEDATPL
  Comment: No SUMMO in this case because 5000ft or above SUMMO is for SID MITOS 2A, not MITOS 1C.

Here you can see, that we entered the Departure MITOS 1C on the FMS.

Then constraints are shown (because I switch on the related button)

You can see that 3100 is indicated as Minimum Altitude.

hope it's help to visulize this on a FMS and how to check you coinstraints.

- Name: nicocache
  Comment: When answering this question I thought that both the right answer and the one with Min 5000 ft at SUMMO should be correct, but now I realise that if you are with 3100 at the first point and with the mandatory climb gradient you will arrive with far more than 5000 ft at SUMMO, so that shouldn't be a problem for you. Still you need to keep the speed restriction, so I think that's the reason why they chose the right answer the one with 3100 ft in D9.5 ALT and speed max 220 kt.
- Name: Kadham
  Comment: @Yanis SUMMO is apart of the MITSU C1 indeed, but the question asks for *during FMS setup* only.

The speed when it is pointing to the turn in the plates means it is restricted for the turn only. And the turn here ended at the waypoint (the small triangle) witch is 6.5 DME as it stated.
- Name: hello545

  Comment: SUMMO passing at or ABOVE 5000ft refers to the "MITOS 2A SID"
- Name: BrunoP
  Comment: If you read the question carefully it states that we are taking off from runway 28. So, we are flying "MITOS 1 C". Not SUMMO because below this waypoint "MITOS 2A" is specified. So this limitation will not affect us, since we are flying another SID. Hope it helps!

Question Number: AT00221
- Name: FredTheRik
  Comment: I don't understand why you're saying that extra fuel has been "replaced" by discretionary fuel? This is not true. I quote from the latest AMC & GM on this topic: "(g) for extra fuel, include anticipated delays or specific operational constraints that can be predicted; and (h) for discretionary fuel, include a quantity at the sole discretion of the commander." To sum it up: the terms "extra fuel" and "discretionary fuel" coexist and have different meanings, but none replaced the other. The correct answer for this question is extra fuel, since it is an anticipated delay, and it doesn't matter whether you look at the old or the new regulation!

- Name: Hussam Razzaq Anbooree
  Comment: The method that I follow is easy

1) I measure the two points distance required in the question, with anything We have, whether a pen or ruler or anything
2) You should not move the image of chart (zoom in/out) when we measure the two points distance
3) We will compare the two-point distance we took with the right-hand side of the numbers in the chart, which are always numbers (NM)
4) The number we took NM, if it is in the options, we will choose it
5) If the number is not in the options, we will convert from NM to KM ==> Multiply the number of NM by 1.852
6) Good luck

  Comment: 1- Calculate Head Wind Component: Cos (angle difference) x Wind speed = cos (50) x 30 = 19 kts => 19 kts head wind
2- Groundspeed = TAS - HWC = 145 - 19 = 126 kts
3- Use the following formula: NAM/TAS=NGM/GS => NAM/145=57/126 => 126 NAM=8265 => NAM=8265/126 = 65.6 NM

  Comment: I personally prefer the formula.

1. M V T
205 15W 190

2. HWC = W/V x cos (angle)
= 30kt x cos (240-190)
= 20kt

3. GS = TAS - HWC ,
= 145 - 20
= 125kt

4. NAM/NGM = TAS/GS
NAM = NGM x TAS / GS
= 57 x 145 / 125
= 66NM
- Name: Veronika
  Comment: I saw 2 same concept questions with very close data given. Dont try to memorize! In one TAS is 125 and answer is 68,5. This one TAS is 145 and answer is 66. It is confusing. So just calculate. I personally use trigonometry formulas for precision.
- Name: Oliver
  Comment: The weather man ever lies.
To get GS you need to set it to True Heading. On a true course of 190 you will drift 10 left. Therefore your true heading will be 200 to account for this. This will read 124 ground speed.

Nam = NGM x TAS/GS .

Answer is bang on.

35 - MOCA

There you can read that MOCA has the suffix T.
- Name: NPilot
  Comment: Between AKUTI and TORTU, there are 2 different altitudes. FL60 and 1600T.
-FL60 corresponds to the MEA (Minium En-route altitude), which is not relevant for this question.
-1600T corresponds to MOCA (minimum obstacle clearance altitude).

We also know that while flying over terrain below 5000 ft we need 1000 ft terrain separation.

1600 ft is the minimum altitude at wich we can fly to have 1000ft clearence from the terrain. 1600 - 1000 = 600 ft

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @SteveG. You can check out EASA AIR OPS, GM1 CAT.OP.MPA.145(a) Establishment of minimum flight altitudes, Minimum Flight Altitudes. The relevant part of it;
(i) MOCA is the sum of:
(A) the maximum terrain or obstacle elevation, whichever is higher; plus
(B) 1 000 ft for elevation up to and including 6 000 ft; or
(C) 2 000 ft for elevation exceeding 6 000 ft rounded up to the next 100 ft
Thank you for your comment.
- Name: Rotorfly
  Comment: According to your MOCA Explanation ..
Are you sure with the elevation 6000 ft?
"Normally, this gives 1000 ft clearance over obstacles up to and including 6000 ft and 2000 ft clearance for obstacles over 6000 ft in elevation."

According to ICAO Doc 8168 the MOC(A) the "mountainous threshold" is "5000 ft"

Or am I missing here something?

  Comment: Guys, let me know if I'm right,
MOCA is 1600ft (1600T) but since we're not in mountains area minimum moca is 1000ft within 8km.

In this case the answer is 600ft because it's 1600-1000= 600ft.

That's correct?

  Comment: Thank you for your clarification. Know I got it :)
- Name: Ben07
  Comment: Thank you for the reply. Unfortunately this does not answer my question. To get the ground speed in this question you do mainly 3 steps on the flight navigator.

1. Mark the wind
2. Set the track
3. Read the ground speed

In other questions (e.g. the #331459 I mentioned) you do 4 steps to get the ground speed.

1. Mark the wind
2. Set the track
3. ADJUST FOR DRIFT
4. Read the ground speed

In this question here it does not make difference if you do this "adjustment step" or not. The final result is pretty much the same.
In other questions (e.g. the #331459) you end up with different results depending on if you do the adjustment or not.

I can't see any difference in the information given of those questions which tells me when I have to do the drift adjustment and when not.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello again @Ben07. If you use the following information, which we mentioned in the previous comment, there will be no need for drift adjustment, because you are reading the WCA directly from the flight computer, not the drift.
When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre.
When the Heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre.
Therefore, among the questions you mentioned, GS was calculated directly in the one solved according to this information. However, GS was calculated after making a "drift adjustment" in the one that had not been solved according to this information.
- Name: Ben07
  Comment: There are very similar questions (e.g. #331459) where the explanation tells that the firstly set true track under the index has to be adjusted with the initial drift. This is not the case here.can you explain why this is not to be done here and how we can differentiate when to do the adjustment and when not?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Ben07, thank you for your comment. We recommend that you follow this rule when using a flight computer.
When the question provides a track => mark wind velocity upwards from centre.
When the Heading is known => mark wind velocity downwards from centre.
However, this is not a strict rule that must always be followed, but rather information that will speed up your question-solving process and make it easier. Let's say you forget whether to mark up or down in the official exam;
When you change the "TRUE HEADING" course on the flight computer if the angle value you find to the right or left is towards the wind specified in the question, it is WCA, and if it is in the same direction as the wind, it is drift.

  Comment: that only makes it difficult

Question Number: AT00230
- Name: Dills01
  Comment: Just add the numbers given, you don't need to calculate anything. Take account of the elevation.
Min alt + Temp correction + VFR 500 + elevation

To start with we dont need to correct for altimeter, as the given QNH at the aerodrome is 998 and the altimeter setting is 998 = NO ALTIMETER CORRECTION

Step 2 is to correct for the temperature. Usually when we do these altimetetry q, we always use the usual formula, but in this question the correction is given to be 240.
Now we locate the location on the map and read out the elevation, which is 1054 AGL.
Since the question is asking For the indicated altitude to CLEAR Class F, we need to locate the boundry for class F; which is 2500.
Therefore we use 2500 as a reference.
First of all the elevation need to be added to the indicated altitude, thereafter the temperature correction, the 2500 ft. which Is the boundry for Class F.

So the formula would be:
2500+1054+240+500=4294
Which is the indicated altitude
- Name: RotorBoat
  Comment: quite an alright question to do, so heres how you do it:
1 ) find the class F airspace (0ft agl - 2500ft agl)
2) add 500+ to it to make it 3000, then add the TEC which is +240 to correct for the fact it is cold (3240ft)
3) find the airport elevation since the airspace is from AGL so you need to make it elevation (add +1054ft to 3240)
your answer will be 4294ft ALTITUDE, as you need it in altitude. ignore the altimeter stuff as it's there to confuse you.

Remember the pressure correction isn't required and nearly caught me out before i realised that the answer was around 4200, and as the airfield and AC are at 998 no correction needed.

  Comment: UK CAA today, same numbers and one of the option was 4294 that's what i went for
- Name: Ziotony
  Comment: I agree that we have to answer what the database marks as correct.
But in real life wouldn't we calculate the sum of altitudes first (1054+2500+500=4054ft) and then add the temperature correction for the actual altitude we are flying (0.008x(-20)x3000)=480ft , instead of ground level? Following the logic of the answer you would apply the same 240ft temp correction no matter what altitude you're flying
- Name: MELS38
  Comment: Guys no need to do any crazy calculation, you need to fly 500ft overhead F airspace upper limit, which is 2500 ft AGL, so gives you 3000ft, but indicated altitude is relative to msl, so you need to add aerodrome's elevation which is 1054ft, so it gives you a total of 4054.
Now you know that temperature is colder than isa, so the altimeter overreads, so one answer possible!
- Name: JKirbs

  Comment: @Johan don't worry about calculating. If they have given you the temperature correction, there is no need to work anything out. Use the one provided.

Simply add the 240 temperature correction to 2500 (airspace) + 500 (clearance) + (1054) elevation.

No pressure calculation needed as QNH is the same.

  Comment: @Andre Hope this can help you!
you have to add the airfield elevation because the airspace vertical limitation is relative to ground (2500 AGL - above ground level -> 2500 ft above the ground ).
But your altitude is not relative to ground, (QNH) is relative mean sea level which differs 1054ft from the elevation at the Aerodrome

- Name: 777umaid
  Comment: Remember that you have true track instead of true heading in the question

with crp-5 using true track you get Drift = -7 (L) , GS 158

from GNAV
True Track = True Heading + Right Drift
True Track = True Heading - Lift Drift

Now once you obtained the drift to the left
get the true Heading

TT 20 = TH - 7 (L) drift
TH = 20 + 7 = 27

rotate to new TH = 27
as of correction you will get :
= 156 GS , with 6 left drift
- Name: Adrian
  Comment: Took me a while but finally understood it. This will help you to get them correct everytime.

Look on your CRP5 where it says TRUE HEADING if you look to the right you find DRIFT STBD (Starboard, drift to the right) and to the left you have DRIFT PORT (drift to the left).
That is where you need to put your drift to correct for it!!

So if you start doing it like always, you place your Track 20 and you get 158kts and 7 drift to the left. Great!
Now you go to the Drift Port on top of the CRP5 that I said before and you align your track (the 20deg) 7 lines towards the left (because we got a 7 drift left before).

After this you will read heading 26, 6 drift left, and 156kts, that is your final answer.
That is how you correct for drift everytime they give you a track instead of a heading.

  Comment: dead on 7L / 158 kts on crp5
- Name: Tom
  Comment: Hey guys I was also getting wrong results with calculations before but I think I figured it out:
When you calculate your groundspeed (GS) you want to calculate from EffectiveTAS and not TAS itself!

Why is that? Your groundspeed will be from the track and not from the heading.
TAS is the speed you have on your heading while EffectiveTAS is the speed you have on your track.
So you need to remove the wind on the effectiveTAS to get your actual ground speed.
Here it would be:
XW= sin(20-60)*30 = 19.28
HW= cos(20-60)*30 ~= 23
WCA = arcsin(19.28/180) ~= 6 degrees
EffectiveTAS = cos(6)*180 = 179 kt
GS = 179-23 = 156 kt

  Comment: Guys you lose engine power at 6500 ft. You will Most likely have to descend, to be able to fly straight. Now if you look at Besor the MHA is at 6500 ft, it will be hard time for you to keep up with this procedure. So Atc will send you further away ALTET where the MHA is at 4000 ft.

I had a similar question where they say your engine fails so you are not able to maintain a high altitude.

What second instruction are we talking about after BESOR if BESOR is the end of STAR and after it you should obtain approach clearance? And if approach clearance is the second instruction, then why is IAF ALT will let us ignore the necessity of further instructions?

the railway that is mentioned in the question is just below the cross section of A9 highway with the A92, beside the ED R-1 box of the zone.
Until there, at the radius mentioned in the question, this is the highest location; 2175ft.
The railway, as it is also described in the legend is a slightly thin grey/black continuous line.
I hope this helps.
Good luck guys!

  Comment: BGS says 2628... So who is correct ?
- Name: John
  Comment: I disagree with the explanation. It has nothing to do with the wind power plant.

The question says from MIKE to proceed SOUTHBOUND via the highway (A9) and then at point of intersection with the railway from Munchen and then from that position - What is the highest obstacle within a 4nm radius?

(Note the intersection is slightly to the NW of EDR-1 and the railway is indicated by a single thin black line crossing the highway)

The highest obstacle from this position 2173ft and so the correct answer is still 2175ft but just to clarify the actual place that is being referenced is further south and not just to the SE of MIKE.

Cheers

Just my opinion - I could be wrong.

For BRNAV, you typically need a combination of Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) and EITHER GPS or VOR/DME. The specific requirements may vary depending on the aviation authority and the aircraft's operational capabilities.

DME and either GPS or VOR/DME

- Name: FaridATPL
  Comment: please clarify, if we are following radial 128, doesnt that mean we are heading 308?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello @FaridATPL, thank you for your comment. In this case, following Radial 128º indicates that the aircraft's magnetic course from the VOR station is 128º. It doesn't necessarily mean the aircraft's heading is 308º. Instead, the aircraft's heading will be adjusted to account for the wind, thereby allowing the aircraft to maintain the radial. So, when you're flying on Radial 128º, think of it as the direction you're moving relative to the ground, and you will adjust your heading to maintain that track, factoring in any wind influence, like in the wind correction calculation in the answer. If you were "heading" 308º, you would actually be moving towards the opposite radial (radial 308º would mean the aircraft is inbound to the station).

  Comment: the explanation for the calculation is wrong. As per the GNAV rules, having a true track/TC(113), TAS and W/V. First we put the wind direction and the speed UPWARDS of the grommet, second select TT at top of 113 in this case and then put the wind dot on the TAS line. The result is 7 degrees drift to the right, WCA-7 degrees.
We would put the wind speed dot down of the grommet when we use a TH.

  Comment: If anyone is struggling to use the CRP5 consistently with these types of questions I highly recommend using the formula:
wind speed x sin (angle between wind and true heading) x 60 / TAS.

After you get the answer, just figure out which way you need to apply it, adding or subtracting from current heading.

For this question:

35 x sin (33) x 60 = 7

- Name: Antoniorosado94
  Comment: Without crp:

Convert true wind to magnetic wind: 80 + 15 = 95 degrees

Find crosswind: sin 33 x ws = 19kt

Find drift angle:
Tan angle = 19kt(crosswind) x 155kt(speed)

Angle = 7 degrees

The wind is coming from your left, it displaces you to your right, so you correct to your left = -7

And then do normal calculations using the VOR radial.

I also set the wind down instead of up and you can see more easily to where it is displacing you

For calculation without flight computer:

Difference in angle between true track and wind direction, in this case 33 degrees.(128 - 15 = 113)
113-80=33
Sin(33)x35kts(wind speed)x60/TAS
And use logic to find out from which side the wind is coming to find out if its plus or minus(towards left=minus; towards right= plus)

  Comment: total endurance = with final reserve
2400kg / 2.3kg/NGM = 869.5 NM x 60 / GS350kt = 178.9 min
or

2400kg / 800kg/h = 3h or 180min
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @FredTheRik, that part of the question was supposed to be a "red herring" from the examiner, and perhaps was fed back to us wrong initially due to this. I have gone through and updated it to 2.3kg/NGM which is close enough. It is possible that it was instead 3.4kg/NAM, perhaps, as this would then give you zero useful information without knowing the wind component. Nonetheless, it should really be solved "the easy way" by doing fuel remaining / fuel flow. Hope this helps.

  Comment: We don't need to consider the condition mentioned in the question "special fuel consumption 3.4kg/NGM"?
Please check if my solution is correct:

Assume the endurance is E, according to the question, I can make an equation as:
FuelFlow * E + (GS * E) / SpecialFuelConsumption = RemainingFuel
substitute with the numbers, I can get:
800E + (350E) / 3.4 = 2800
By solving the function to find the value of E,
E = 3.11h = 186 minutes

  Comment: Endurance = 2 400 kg / 800 kg/h = 3 hours (180 minutes)

Total Endurance is the amount of time an aircraft can stay in the air until its tanks are dry (which includes final reserve fuel.
- Name: aloqaily1
  Comment: @Michal is right with what he said, but he probably couldn't explain it in the best way..

The idea is that the engine consumes 3.4 kilograms of fuel per 1 NGM, so to know how many NGMs can we fly with this remaining fuel, we can simply divide 2400 over 3.4 which will give us 705.9 NGM.. that basically means we can cover only 705.9 NGM (with this engine performance and with this remaining fuel)..

By considering our groundspeed, which is 350 kt, the time we need to cover those 705.9 NGM will be 121 minutes.. that means (with these values) we can only fly for 121 minutes until our tanks are totally dry.

Since the endurance that we calculated from the average fuel flow is 180 minutes, there are two explanations to this, it's either that we need to pick the more restrictive value (121 minutes), or with this engine performance, the fuel flow cannot be 800 kg/h.

The specific fuel consumption usually give us a higher amount of time when compared to the endurance which is based on the fuel flow.. but if this's not the case, we should choose the more restrictive value which is 121 minutes.. because yeah we can fly for 180 minutes based on this fuel flow, but the degraded engine performance can only provide us with 121 minutes of flying.

I don't know if this question appeared exactly like this, because that makes it 100% appealable. But if it was created based on an uncomplete information then please consider modifying the given values.

Best of luck everyone, WE GOT THIS!

With a wind direction of 310 degrees (T), the crosswind component is more than 20, which give us a left drift between 7 and 8. Crosswind component of 16 (as explanation says) is completely wrong.

  Comment: For ppl who don't wanna use CRP (math method is safest)
// this is not something that I came up with, there are similar questions in GNAV and this is the math method to solve them

We have the following formula: WCA (wind correction angle) = crosswind component x (TAS/60)
OBS: We don't use variation, because everything is in deg Magnetic.

1. Crosswind Comp = (sin angle between track and wind) x wind speed // Crosswind= sin(330-210) x 25kt = 21.65 (we take the next higher integer value => 22kt)
2. WCA = 22kt / (179/60) = 7.37deg (closest answer is 8deg)

Good luck!

  Comment: @BouncedLanding I see your point, but the distances we're calculating are so small that it really doesn't make much of a difference. Honestly, once you get the hang of it, Pythagoras is way faster and consistently more accurate than using a map, especially with the time constraints in an exam! Plus, in this case, the magnetic course and distance are already providedjust follow airway Y70 and your good. Of course, it's up to you which method you prefer. Ive passed both GNAV and FLN, and Pythagoras hasnt failed me yet. (Fun fact: since this method uses parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude, the angles within the triangle are components to finding the aircrafts true course!)
- Name: BouncedLanding
  Comment: @RotorRider departure can only be used if the points are on the same parallel, however you can get a more accurate aprox if you calculate the change of latitude and longitude between the points in NM and then use pythagoras to find the diagonal distance.

  Comment: Additional fuel cannot be the correct answer, it is explicitly stated in the question that the Commander accounted for trip, contingency, alternate and final reserve fuel, but not for the stated EO situation, thus no additional fuel was loaded. Where there is no additional fuel loaded, NO additional fuel can be used.
Oxford Aviation Book:
Additional fuel: Contingency, Alternate and Final Reserve fuel cover most cases, and provided that suitable diversions are available en route and near the destination, this is all that is required for Reserve Fuel. There are two cases, however, where Additional Fuel may be needed: No ALTN, NO ERA and Inability to HOLD HEIGHT

  Comment: I dont understand why are we talking about Additional Fuel, when obviously we have alternate aerodrome in the context, which means we have Alternate fuel for our flight, therefore we dont need Additional Fuel.

Additional Fuel is only needed if we don't have Alternate fuel or when we have a task including a Pre determined point PDP.

@atplq could please explain why do we have an Additional Fuel in this case in order to consider that this is the correct answer, instead of the one with Contingency, which in my opinion is more correct..

I agree with @ATPLQ on the the idea the Final Reserve should be accounted for only for the fuel emergency. Like a real deal emergency when your engines are about to flame out because of dry tanks. Land ASAP basically.
Engine failure is not always an emergency! Hear me out on this. What if we have 4 engines? You can cross the Atlantic with this condition. Yes, its highly unpleasant, but not an emergency. So dont allow EASA to trigger the thought in your head that if something is off, its Final Reserve fuel. Good luck everyone!

  Comment: @atpl , there is another question clarify that final reserve fuel is for emergencies and could not be used so why the answer with final reserve is incorrect

  Comment: • STARs use ground navigational aids
• RNAV STARs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS
• RNAV STAR overlay allows pilots to use GNSS
- Name: jakehalliday
  Comment: Have a look at the GSPRM charts for Stuttgart 10-3B and 10-3N2.

10-3B is the conventional SID with waypoints defined as radials and distances from the STG VOR, so is not an RNAV SID.
10-3N2 is an RNAV overlay SID with the exact same routing but with GPS waypoints, not using any conventional navaids as references.
- Name: Messi10
  Comment: This is what my friend (chatgpt) says:
Key Differences:
SID/STAR: Based on ground-based navigation aids like VOR and NDB.
RNAV SID/STAR: Uses satellite or onboard navigation systems for precise and flexible routing, not dependent on ground-based aids.
RNAV Overlay: Provides an RNAV-based option for an existing traditional SID/STAR route, allowing both RNAV and non-rnav aircraft to follow the same path using different technologies.

In summary, sid/star uses traditional navigation aids, rnav sid/star uses modern satellite-based systems for more flexible routing, and rnav sid/star overlay bridges the gap between the two by allowing both rnav and non-rnav aircraft to follow similar procedures.

  Comment: Final RESERVE its 1200 so knowing that it Last for 30 min we know that holding fuel flow its 2400 per hour

- Name: zeymahse
  Comment: Whoever said that the lighted mast is also a viable option, should realize that that's a trick option. There are no lighted masts nearby the NW point. The mast right next to the NW point standing 378' high is not lighted and the closest lighted ones are too far away. Check north-west from NW point or south-east from it. These two, 1st standing 515' and 2nd standing at 544' are too far away to be considered a good visual check point for NW point. If the question spoke about the nearby mast or the nearby non lighed mast, it could have been a "correctish" option but the intesection is way better for 1 simple reason: It's the only interesction close to the NW point, and it's right below it. So if you fly right above the intersection, you KNOW that you are AT the NW point.
- Name: Lince01
  Comment: In reality you would use the combination of both, the tower and the junction, since you could drift due to wind and find yourself in the junctions at the north of the city and have a false sense of being on the right waypoint.

  Comment: Annoying question, but stating VISUAL checkpoint, you can eliminate 2 answers. Then it says LIGHTED Mast, therefore you can eliminate another answer because the mast next to WP is NOT lighted. Leaves you with only 1 answer, which of course is still ambiguous saying *only junction*..
- Name: Marguez
  Comment: I know is frustrating guys but in VFR navigation, highway junctions are a very common checkpoint as they are clearly distinguishable and easy to identify from above, so in a question if you see that the Visual Point is over an junction, then that junction will be the landmark to search for, even if there are more in the vicinity.

  Comment: cz.caa feb 2023:-
refer to nantes chart 19-1 from jeppesen gsprm. an aeroplane is departing from nantes to
conduct vfr flight to the northwest and will cross waypoint (nw). what will be the best visual check point to
check the position at waypoint (nw):-

a) by checking your position with bearing and distance from nts vor/dme.

b) the lighted mast next to nw.

c) by checking your position using gnss.

d) by looking for the highway/motorway junction which is the only junction in that area. (i choose ''d'') cause they didn't mention distance so it's different case, if distance is mentioned than use ''vor/dme option a''

- Name: Joshua
  Comment: Just because you are flying VFR is does not mean you cannot use instruments to navigate. Flying VFR means you are maintaining Visual Meterological Conditions and in most airspaces, you will be responsible for separation from terrain and other trafferic.

A lot of VFR-only aircraft will not have a DME, some not even a VOR receiver, but if you did have it, it would be far more reliable and accurate than only looking for a highway junction in an area of many highway junctions.

GNSS could also be used, but EASA doesn't like people to become complacent with it, since (very rarely) it can be unreliable
- Name: Nitrometano53
  Comment: @atplq on a VFR aircraft is not mandatory to have a DME.

We would need further feedback before we actually change the correct option for this question. Highway junction would certainly be the correct option if it was the only one in the area.

  Comment: Guys, in these kind of q there is no need to go into the graph. Just choose the option with the least headwind as this has the greater influence than temperature. if there are two altitude with the same wind as in this question, choose the colder one. worked every time for me
- Name: Jellows
  Comment: Also got the question @ joaomsilval mentions. Sweden 25 June 2025. It is provided a table (not from the CAP) with different TAS for the altitudes. The Fuel Flow is 15GPH for all altitudes. There is a column telling you specifik range NM/Gallon, and it says 15 for 7000 and 8000 ft, then 15,3 and 15,5 for 9000 and 10.000. I don't think it's what you are supposed to use to solve the question.
- Name: Gotiasan
  Comment: For this results so close to each other, go for the highest one with the lowest headwind.
If you see the results before the wind correction, the highest is the fastest.

Hope it helps
- Name: joaomsilval
  Comment: Got a similar question today. it was given the CAP table with the fuel consumption and KTAS. Said that the flight route was to be conducted between 7000 and 10000 feet. then gave the headwind components of 9 for 6000, 10 for 7000, and for 8000 13 I guess, and 9000 not needed and then 10000 16kts. asked about what flight level would be the best based on the fuel consumption. options were 6000, 7000, 8000, 10000.

- Name: Nicewicz
  Comment: 1. Look at winds and find the lowest headwinds
2. Only two answer left (both with 10 kt HW)
3. Look at temperatures and alt -> the higher you fly the less fuel u burn + colder OAT = better performance
4. Choose the answer with higher alt and lower OAT.

No need to waste time on this question especially during exam <3
- Name: Máximo
  Comment: As they are asking for most fuel efficient situation you can answer without doing the graphic, and saving time knowing:

1. With (+) headwind the aircraft will have (-) GS -> (+) time to reach destination -> (+) fuel consumption
2. Engines are more efficient at lower temperatures [performance]

The option that best fits is 6000 ft
- Name: michaels
  Comment: Austro Vienna yesterday.
I appearantly had a different version of this question, as others have mentioned below. Given where 5 altitudes and HWC (6000, 7000, 8000, 10000 and one more) and the power setting, and the question asked for the best specific nautical ground miles per gallon. The annex had 3 tables for different power settings. Each table had altitudes in 2000 ft increments and contained among other data CAS, TAS and NM/Gallon. Had never seen this before so I just guessed that the NM/Gal in the table had to be NAM. With the given TAS and HWC I got the GS for each altitude and factored the NM/Gal from the table with the TAS and GS to get NGM/Gal.
Correct answer was 7000.

  Comment: So we are sup. to draw each of those 4 situations. Find the exact TAS, apply headwind and decide which situation will give us the highest speed on the 45% power setting, right?
I got, using laser precision and NO TIME CONSTRAINS, because after all, FPL is NOT a time critical exam (right??) :

option 1 GS = 123 kt
option 2 GS = 126 kt <-
option 3 GS = 125.5 kt <-
option 4 GS = 119.5 kt

I got lucky and chose the right option guessing between two.

  Comment: Most fuel efficient = Least headwind or highest tailwind + Highest Altitude
- Name: LorenzoD
  Comment: in Q 336234 you give us this explanation:
The fuel efficiency for each cruise altitude is measured using the Specific Air Range formula: SAR = TAS / Fuel Flow, which determines the number of NAMs flown per unit of fuel used.
You also specify in the comments that:
As the explanation states, the fuel efficiency for each cruise altitude is measured using the Specific Air Range formula: SAR = TAS / Fuel Flow. Since it's TAS and not GS, the headwind isn't taken into consideration.
Now please explain why in this case we need to take headwind into consideration

Atencion a los de Senasa, la tabla tiene muy mala resolucion y la linea del ordenador es muy gruesa y dificulta mucho diferenciar entre 6000 y 7000 al calcular el resultado. Recomiendo memorizar para no perder mucho tiempo. Tuve que hacerla 4 veces y contando pixeles para que me pueda dar lo que recordaba era la respuesta correcta.

- Name: LAWRENCE
  Comment: Arguably, if you have 6000' and 8000' giving the same TAS you should chose the lower one as it will use less fuel to climb to the lower altitude so the overall efficiency of the flight will be the greater.
- Name: Fabian
  Comment: It is indeed very close but if you draw close enough and Interpolate with the Length between 6000 and 8000 instead of Eyeballing the middle, a 1 kt difference can be seen. BUT .. Answers so close together are a pathetic test of your ability in a high stress situation .. so Whatever!

Interpolation:
Top Number - Bottom number over/divided by middle number - bottom number is equal to =
Top Number - Bottom number over/divided by middle number - bottom number
eg. for the NGM/NAM calc

150 - 100/ 130 - 100 = 161 - 108/ x - 108 then solve by basic algebra (cross multiply) you get at the end 5x = 699.. x = 139.8 or 140

if then i do a proportion, i get that 1.15 : 125 = x : 140 and then the actual result should be around 1.288 for 140nam which is 1288kg. why do they get 1240 as correct? i get that 1300kg cant be cause it is the value for 150 in the table but still

- Name: MerchantBanker
  Comment: Simple way of solving this q:

Go to the bottom, using 280 as TAS
Then the formula NAM= NGM x TAS/GS
130 x (280/260) = 140 (NAM)
To interpolate:
Go back into the bottom table where FL 130 intersects between 100-150 NAM
A way that worked for me - Find the difference between 1300 and 1000 = 300, 150-100 is 50
300/50= 6, (say 60)
1300-60= 1240kgs

  Comment: UK CAA (Remember to come back and mark as seen after your exams).
- Name: WillB
  Comment: No need to interpolate the first part, look at the bottom of the chart. Based on 280kts.

Therefore you can use NAM = NGM x (TAS/GS)
With HW20, GS =260
NAM = 130 x (280/260) = 140NAM

Will save time in the exam!

  Comment: @JAVI

I figured it out, bear with me:

find the two squares between your desired value, for us its 130 between 100 and 150.
SUBSTRACT 100 FROM 150, YOU GET 50. This means the NGM increases by 50 between squares.
SUBSTRACT 108 FROM 161, YOU GET 53. This means the NAM increases by 53 between squares.

now we know our value is 130, so this means from 100, it increases with 30.. soo we have;

+ 53 for + 50
+ x for +30

30 x 53 / 50 will give you 32, it increases by 32.
now add 32 to 108, you get 140 nam. it's the same shit for all other interpolations, unless it obvious are daylight that the middle value corresponds to the average (x+y)/2 or (x+y+z)/3 so on and so forth.

hope this helps, i hate these questions with a god damn passion.

second interpolate result value (AIR DISTANCE = 139,8) wtih 55 000kg on lower table (You should interpolate between 1.0 and 1.3 so (1,3-1)/50*39,8= 0,2388) add one and you have 1,2388KG

1. actual fuel burn 375 - 258 = 117 in 50 minutes , in 60 minutes --> 50/117 X 60 = 140.4
2. planned fuel burn 360 - 241 = 119 in 53 minutes , in 60 minutes --> 53/119 X 60 = 134.7

Difference 140.4 - 134.7 = 5.6 kg/hr ~ 5 kg is the answer

for all:
props:
45m + 15% of cruise (from TOC to TOD, not the total flight time)
OR
2 hours

whichever is less, will be the fuel

  Comment: Guys I saw that trick in a comment so I put it here too.
All the questions of isolated with reciprocating engines (only reciprocating) can be done adding 40kgs to the fuel consumption.

Good luck.
- Name: Justus1
  Comment: We know: 720kg/h
720/60 =12kg / minute
12 * 45 =540kg
15% of Cruise (cruise is 2h/or 120 minutes)
0,15*120 =18
18 * 12 =216
540kg + 216kg =756 kg
760kg is nearest!
- Name: Vasiliy
  Comment: Why is 2h used instead of 2.5h to calculate the 15% cruise time?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Vasiliy, thank you for your comment. As stated in the explanation, this calculation is based on;
for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes plus 15% of the flying time planned to be spent at cruising level or two hours, whichever is less or
The planned flight time at cruise level (top of climb to top of descent) in this question is already 2 hours.

  Comment: final reserve??
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Tailstrike99, thank you for your comment. An Isolated aeroddrome is one for which the alternate and final fuel reserve required to the nearest adequate destination alternate aerodrome for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines is more than:
fuel to fly for 45 minutes plus 15% of the planned flight time to be spent at cruising level or
2 hours, whichever is lower.

35.5nm x 1.852 = 65.74km should be the right answer.
Sometimes you can accept some inaccuracies in the answers, or to take the closest, but for gods sake this is putting a ruler on a map!
Why should there be a closest answer that just makes us unsure if we got it right or not, to second guess ourselves?
And then for whoever wrote this explanation youre worse, because you purposefully let on you get 36.2nm after measuring, when in reality you reverse engineered your calculation from the answer to justify the error that is this question.

  Comment: The plotting ruller is not suitable for measuring distances on this map, as it has small difference between chart scale and ruller scale, altough in theory should work, as they have the same scale. If we put the ruller along a meridian, will not give the same NM as the difference in minutes between, say 1 degree of latitude change, and the error is cumulative, after some 50NM on the ruller, the chart distance is something smaller, say 52-53NM. It's better to use a normal ruller, in cm, and measure and then use the scale from the right side of the map provided

Question Number: AT00265
- Name: joaolopes
  Comment: Question: why would an IFR flight would clear an 6000ft obstacle by just 1500ft. does not have to be 2000ft clearance above 5000ft?
- Name: AbzHat123
  Comment: UK CAA 23/06 different numbers and track was 178 M so easterly instead
- Name: William2002
  Comment: Altimetry is far easier than people make it out to be.

An aircraft of an IFR flight on a track of 225(M) has to clear an otacle of 6,600ft by 1,500ft. If the QNH Is 1030hpa and the temperature is ISA -15C, what is the lowest Flight Level at which the aircraft may fly to clear the otacle?

1)>We'll start with the true altitude that we need to fly at to be clear of the otacle:
6,600+1,500 = 8,100ft. true

2)>Next we need to find indicated. Since it is colder than ISA, our altimeter will overread. It will read higher than our true altitude. For those that have completed Meteorology, we know that this is dangerous.

>We use the 4% rule which you can search on YouTube if you haven't heard of it.
8,100 divided by 1,000 = 8.1

8.1 x 4 x -15 (-15 from Question) = -486. You must add 486 to your true altitude when it is colder than standard temp.
8,100 + 486 = 8586 indicated.

3) >Next we must go to standard pressure (1013) for our flight level. 1013-1030 = -17.
-17x30 = -510.
>So you are flying along at 8586ft in your 172. What happens if you decrease the QNH in the altimeter? Your altitude reading will go down. So we are going from 1030hpa to 1013hpa.
8586-510 = 8076ft.

FL80 isn't possible. We are flying West so we must be on an even flight level, therefore FL90 and FL110 aren't our answers either.
FL10 is our answer.

- Name: XavierNP
  Comment: Okay at this point it doesn't make any sense .. How are we supposed to know where the meteorological station is?
In some questions, we have to assume that it is at obstacle height, and in others at MSL.
I guess we have to somehow appeal every single altimetry question not specifying the altitude of the station. Even if to me, the most logical would be to consider the station at MSL when not specified as we do in Meteo.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL).
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

- Name: MisterAscot
  Comment: ATPLQ are misleading you all very badly here folks because they don`t understand how temperature error works and have ignored a fundamental theoretical point stated in the relevant LO for temperature error in their post on 13 Dec 2022: i.e. sub-para e) "the elevation of the AERODROME has to be taken into account. The temperature error has to be considered for the layer between the ground and the position of the aircraft" It is an obvious fact that airfields and met stations are located ON THE GROUND as opposed to floating in mid-air. Furthermore, not every patch of ground actually houses an airfield. If there is no mention of an airfield/met station at ground/obstacle level at all in the question, (as is the case here) then we are forced to assume that the QNH calculation elevation (pressure measurement datum) is at SEA LEVEL itself.
- Name: Domenico
  Comment: ATPLQ
it is not consistent among questions the calculation of the temperature error. In this explanation is calculated on the full column of air in others questions (i.e. 339725) the explanation calculate the error only on the column of air between the altitude and the obstacle.
What is the correct way?

- Name: Marcolino
  Comment: I remember the answer like this:
With a HDW you will spend more time in the wind so it will blow you away (to the left in this case).
With a TLW you will spend less time in the wind so it will blow you less making you veer in to the wind, because of the correction angle (right in this case).
I know this isn't the right mathematical way of solving it but helped me a lot.
- Name: martinc
  Comment: @CarloRomaFlyPe because the question is giving you the True Heading and not the True Track. So you have to use the "wind down" method in your CR3. If it were the True Track then you use the "wind up" method.
- So for example with a TAS of 100 you will have initially a GS of 87 kt and a drift of almost 22° to the left. And with the new wind you would get a GS of aprox 125 kt and a drift of 16° to the left (so your new course will be on the right).

  Comment: Visual explanation with CRP5/E6B:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wCuzDyF...

You see that with wind coming from 160, you drift less.
But as your heading was chosen for a wind from 100, you will drift (left) less than expected, so you will end up right of track (because less left drift).
- Name: Wiberus
  Comment: Get your CRP5, put it somewhere in the higher TAS area so the scale is more readable, like 200kt or so.. and than put the course as the true heading, and turn the vector. You will than imidiately see the diference in drift
- Name: Dannn
  Comment: If we are flying 040 with wind from 160 we are being pushed to the left with slight tailwind.
- Name: FlyingLegend
  Comment: @Typhoon, it's even easier. You just set the Heading of 40 and then compare the drift when wind is coming from 100 and from 160. More drift left than with wind from 100 = track is more left
Less drift left than with wind from 100 = track is more right
- Name: NADER
  Comment: 1- assume that you want to follow the track of 030 , wind is from the right so you are keeping the heading of 040

wind is 100/40 , track is 030 so the angle between the wind and track is 70

2- but the real wind is from 160/40 , now to keep yourself on track 030 (reciprocal of 030 is 210) the angle between the track and wind is now 50 !
Now crosswind Angle is less so you should keep a lower heading than 040 but you are keeping the same heading of 040 that ends you up more to the right of track.

Tried to make it simple but still too much explanation!! Hope it helps
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: ok maybe i get it. i have a TH=40 so if i choose a random TAS=100 for the sake of the exercise i can see that my actual drift with a planned wind of 100deg, will be around 20left. so my TT=20
if i set 20 as TT i can then see that if my wind comes from 160deg i would have an actual drift of around 15deg left. so my WCA has to be 15deg right, which puts me on a TT= 20+15=35
so my actual TT will be 35 instead of a planned TT of 20. so we can say that track will be right of the planned course.
i dunno if it is a correct statement. but seems to workout. hope it helps depict better the situation.
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: with cr3 i get the same crosswind and the same drift. i dont get it.
- Name: YebacTecnamy
  Comment: This is true that the crosswind angle is the same BUT before it was HEADWIND, now it is TAILWIND.

Try to visualize it. Think of marginal case. Imagine you are going 100 knots. The wind is blowing 95 knots almost along your track, only few degrees from side. If this is tailwind, you are going 200 knots and barely see any wind correction needed. If this is headwind you almost stay in place and this little crosswind vector is now a really big vector when compared to your speed vector (like 45 degrees or so).

You can also try to think like that: The wind in either case pushes me off track with the same force. However, If this is tailwind, I am staying for very short time under the influence of the crosswind. If this is headwind, I am staying very long under its influence so I will be more offtrack for the same distance traveled (because wind could push me for longer time because of my lower ground speed), thus correction angle bigger.

Hope this helps!
- Name: Yannick27
  Comment: use your flight computer and everything will be easier to visualize:

If the heading is 040 with right crosswind, then the actual track is to our left (heading 040 compensates for winds, so the planned track is, for example, 030, as we put nose to the wind to keep on track)

So if the track is 030, wind from 100 will be close to full crosswind, while a wind from 160 will be less crosswind. So if we planned for more crosswind (correction for wind at 100) but the actual wind is from 160 (less cross) we will be compensating too much and fly into the wind, so to the right of track.

I visualize it like this, i think it might be a correct explanation?
- Name: SamGamshi
  Comment: 100 deg will also act with a HWC, thus increasing the time the XWC can act on you.

160 deg will act with a TWC, thus decreasing the time the XWC can act on you
--> less left drift than planned, but HDG according to planned left drift
--> RIGHT DRIFT
- Name: DocDoc
  Comment: The confusion stems from using the basic crosswind/headwind formula. It isn't suitable for in-flight wind component, period. You can find the same comments over and over again in GNAV and in Flight Planning. Long story short: formula calculates the wind without taking into the account the speed of the aircraft. So, what exactly do I mean?

Take your CRP-5/E6B and look at the "speed" plate. At "0" TAS the 90 degrees crosswind will always result in full crosswind component, as you would get from the formula. But, when the speed grows, the speed plate gets more and more bent, semi-circular. You can check that by applying the 90 degrees wind with heading set at 360 -> pretty much at any in flight speed with higher wind component, you will always get some residual headwind even in full 90 degrees crosswind, which formula doesn't take account for.

To find the correct values. Take your computer, set your TAS at any speed value, let's use 100 for simplicity. Then measure the drift for heading 040 with both the values. For planned (120/40) it's 24L, for actual (160/40) it's 16L. We have less left drift, so we are right from the track.
- Name: CommandantSharma
  Comment: Guys don't mix up "planned track"/ "actual track". Here is how I got this:
-> Planned track = Track drawn on the map without any kind of correction
-> Actual track = Track which is flown but with a difference because of the real flight event (weather etc.)
SO
1) Both tracks are on the left of the heading for sure.
2) BUT as the wind come from the right, the actual track will automatically be on the right of the planned track.
- Name: AirbusFr
  Comment: I can't understand. I have the same crosswind components for both winds? And both come from the right
- Name: TheMegaDon
  Comment: I get that the angle of drift is still the same regardless of distance travelled but if the crosswind component is the same then the only change is the ground speed. And TAS is the factor not ground speed in the drift formula 60 / TAS x crosswind comp.
- Name: Maverickopoulos
  Comment: An easy way of solving this is figure out a random TAS (say 200kts) ans set on your CRP-5 the TAS, TH and the W/V for both cases and read the Drift Angle. With W/V 100/40 the Drift is 11L while with W/V 160/40 the Drift is 9L, thus we will end up to the right of the planned Track.

  Comment: In both case crosswind is the same but GS will be different, in one case we have headwind in the other case we have tail wind. So if we calculate the WCA it will be different and the WCA will be greater with headwind.

  Comment: Use TRACK for wind correction stuff not Heading. So you can imagine, the track is less than 040. Thus, the crosswind component of the actual wind is less than the forecast
- Name: Gianluca
  Comment: To solve this question (when HDG is given) i use this logic:

HDG = 040

Wind _1 = 100/40 -> CW = 20 | HW = 20

Wind_2 = 160/40 -> CW = 20 | TW = 20

As in Wind_2 we are going FASTER (higher groundspeed), we are subject to the CW component for a SHORTER amount of time when a certain distance is flown. That means we are deviating LESS to the left than with Wind_1 (where we are SLOWER so subject to the cw for more time).

So if we are deviating LESS to the left, it means we are more on the right.
- Name: Domonkos
  Comment: @ATPLQ I think your explanation is wrong. If you would draw the wind vectors, you would get that the perpendicular components (so the amount of crosswind) to your 40 degrees heading are the same for the two cases. Because as Carlos said sin120=sin60 and the wind velocities are the same as well. BUT when we take into account the crosswind to get the drift or WCA, we have to compare it to the track not heading. As the wind is coming from the right initially, our track will be less than our heading depending on our TAS. Consequently, if you calculate the crosswind components compared to a track that is less than 40, let's say 35 (just for the example) you will get sin(160-35)=0,819 and sin(100-35)=0,906. So compared to the track the perpendicular component of the wind from 160 degrees will be slightly less than initially from 100 degrees.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello everyone, I appreciate your comments. Upon reviewing the explanation, it appears to be quite clear. For those who may be having difficulty with this question, my suggestion is to use your CRP-5 for each given wind W/V, while selecting any TAS of your preference. This will reveal that the drift with a wind of 100ºT/40 kt is greater than the drift with the actual wind of 160ºT/40 kt. In both cases, there will be a port drift, causing the inflight track to be right of the planned track.

  Comment: @ATPLQ Can you explain what is the difference with this question and No: 333487 compared with question No:338305? they seem to be talking about very similar situations, however answers and methods to solve them are completely different.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: @Juan, actually this question and question 333587 are almost the same, they are asking similar things but symmetrically. However, in question 338305 we are not given a heading instead the track is given so the heading will be adjusted according to the wind. But the effect of changing wind is the same as their crosswind components are the same. Hope it helps!

- Name: Solicab
  Comment: When they say *isolated* shouldnt we assume that the flight has not alternate aerodrome?
If so, that means we have to use 15mins @ holding over destination.
If we are using the 2h cruising fuel it would be we have a predetermined point (PDP) and an alternate aerodrome to deviate to.
I really want to get this right and it seems very confusing. Either there is some text missing from the question or the method needs reviewing ??
I would really appreciate input on this.
Thank you
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hey @Solicab. This regulation is outdated, so this question should no longer appear in exams. If you encounter it in your exam, be sure to appeal.
A flight to an isolated aerodrome is treated as a flight using the Predetermined Point (PDP) procedure. According to EASA AIR OPS (AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.150(b) Fuel Policy), for an aircraft with turbine engines operating to an isolated aerodrome, the Additional fuel must be sufficient to fly for 2 hours at normal cruise consumption above the isolated destination aerodrome. Furthermore, this Additional fuel requirement must not be less than the Final Reserve fuel. Simply put, the Final Reserve fuel plus an Extra fuel quantity must together meet the requirement for 2 hours of cruise flight above the isolated aerodrome.

  Comment: In the PDP procedure (isolated aerodrome procedure) The additional fuel replaces the Alternate & Final reserve fuel.

  Comment: I still have difficulty to understand why we subtract the final reserve from 5296. Anyone can explain it?
Based on this "for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for two hours at normal cruise consumption above the destination aerodrome, including final reserve fuel" We should include the final reserve no? @atplq
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Budlight, according to EASA AIR OPS (AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.150(b)) for an aircraft with turbine engines flying to an isolated aerodrome, the additional fuel must not be less than the fuel to fly 2 hours at normal cruise consumption above the isolated aerodrome and this (additional fuel quantity) should not be less than the Final reserve fuel. In other words, this means that the final reserve fuel quantity plus an extra fuel quantity must give the additional fuel quantity (i.e. fuel quantity that is enough to fly for 2 hours. Therefore, this can be expressed as: Extra fuel + Final reserve fuel = Fuel required to fly for 2 hours at normal cruise consumption.
Given that final reserve fuel is 1170 kg and fuel required to fly for 2 hours equals 5296 kg, extra fuel quantity will be 5296 kg - 1107 kg = 4189 kg.
I hope this answers your question :) Good luck on your exams!

- Name: AEROLEX7
  Comment: Guys you can actually save a lot of time with those questions doing a rule of three:

460 NM - 187 NM = 273 NM
1314 lb - 795 lb = 519 lb

Now with those numbers we can get the fuel needed for the rest of the flight:
187 NM -- 519 lb
273 NM -- X = (273x519) / 187 = 757

Now we substract this from the remaining fuel for the trip:
795 lb - 757 lb = 38 lb
The result may not be as exact as doing the long process like in the explanation, but it's 100% correct and always the closest answer garanteed.

Hope it helps and good luck!

3. 1314 - 1277 = 37 lb remaining fuel at B
- Name: YounesSebbouba
  Comment: My way :

First determine the GS :

TAS = 120
TWC = 20
GS = 140

Calculate the new Fuel Flow :

We flew 187nm in 1hour and 20 minutes --> 1h20 = 1.333
Fuel remaining is 795lb plus reserve
Trip fuel is 1314lb

1314 - 795 = 519lb

New Fuel Flow = 519 / 1.333 = 389 lb/h

Calculating time remaining to airport B :

460nm - 187nm = 273nm to the destination

T = D/S
T = 273 / 140
T= 1.95

Now we can calculate the fuel remaining at airport B like this :

Time to dest x New fuel Flow --> 1.95 x 389 = 758 lb

Fuel remaining = 795 - 758 = 37 lb plus reserve !

Hope it'll help ! Best of luck y'all

  Comment: There are 3 same - but slightly different - questions in the bank which kinda follow EASA BS bingo rules. But the more FPL calculations you do, the more you will be able to understand the wording: the key here is the word "PLANNED"..whenever it appears, you should immediately become suspicious. "Wait! Conditions stay the same? But there is a planned consumption he provides us with?"

In 187NM we consumed 519 lb fuel and our trip distance remaining is 460-187=273NM
if in 187NM we consumed 519lb fuel, how much we will consume in 273NM?
We do that with a proportion:
187:519=273:x
x= 519*273/187=757,68 lb
795-757,68=37,31 lb remaining ~ 36lb

  Comment: one hint to get faster at these Q's folks is to be prepared to use fuel flow as lb per nm. Don't always default to using time. Sometimes per nm is faster so keep it in mind.

In this case:

1. fuel used so far = 1314 - 795 = 519lb
2. fuel flow so far = 519 / 187 = 2.7754 lb/nm
3. fuel used for whole trip = 2.7754 * 460 = 1276lb
4. fuel left = 1314 - 1276 = 38lb approx 36

Job done. No times needed.

If planned fuel were used, it would have burnt 400 x 1.33 = 532 ... BUT 1314 - remaining fuel (795) would equal 521lb so in fact in 1.33hrs, 521lb has been burnt meaning a better fuel consumption (likely down to the tail wind). 521 / 1.33 = 392lb / hr
so ... 273nm to go at 140kt = 1.95hrs x 392lb = 764lb

764lb subtract this from the remaining fuel (793) = 35 lb + reserves
- Name: Michal
  Comment: @ATPLQ your explenation is not what EASA want.

140 nm - 1 h
460 nm - = 3,28 h

3,28 h x 400 lb/h = 1312 lbs

the whole trip

519 lbs - 187 nm
x - 140 nm flight speed

From proportion :

x = 388 lbs/h

1,95 h the remaining time
1,95 h x 388 = 757 lbs all consumption


795 - 757 = 37 + reserv

- Name: klappan
  Comment: Once you overfly EDNP to join the pattern on the flipside, the lighted obstacle 2058 ft is the one you need to worry about. Clearly the most important one here, and it's just ridiculous that it's not included as one of the options
- Name: zeymahse
  Comment: Here, you should disregard the 5NM rule as the question specifically asks you to look for the highest lighted obstacle on the DIRECT route. Plain and simple wordplay meant to trick you, confuse you and ultimately, make you fail. This subject is full of wordplay as FPL would otherwive be too easy.
Get used to wordplay, it's everywhere and on every subject.
- Name: Carlospas
  Comment: If you're not told anything about the 5NM, just don't assume it.
Anyways, the only lighted objets along the track and 5NM left and right OF THE TRACK (not around aerodromes)
are 1528ft and 1965ft.
The 2058ft tower is further than our destination.
- Name: MayorTom
  Comment: No sense at all If I mark the 5 nm deal I can see just and the spot the 2918 , if I make a straight line yes under the line I get the 1965, but you see this topic its very arbitrary, sometimes they spec this some times that , eg 30 or 27 for qnh correction
- Name: Ben07
  Comment: There is a lighted obstacle very close to EDNP (2058ft) like many others already mentioned. According to your drawing in the explanation this obstacle should not be considered because it is "behind" the intended track.

Nevertheless I saw other very similar questions where a circle of 5 NM was drawn at the start and end of the track as well and where obstacles being within this circle have been considered too. Can you point out when obstacles being in this circle have to be considered and when not?

  Comment: As another option, first of all, one of the answers offered is for an NDB, so from the start it's not a possibility. Then, instead of searching the whole chart section relevant, and wasting time, you could go on the back of the chart and search for the remaining nav aids, in that list, for the appropiate name and frequency, and you will just pick it up with the coordinates as well. It takes max 2 min instead of 7 min trying to locate each nav aid on the map. Now it's up to each student what method to use, but just wanted to share my method with you :). Cheers !

2. VOR, LKSR, 123,50MHz incorrect - Freq used for radio voice communication
3. VOR, RODING 114.70 MHz incorrect navaid designator

So, only VOR/DME, RDG, 114,70MHz is correct

It is inconsistent with the outage times given in the NOTAM text. They point to the year 2019.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @FredTheRik. You are correct, there is a discrepancy between the validity periods listed in fields B) and C) and the dates outlined in field E) of the NOTAM. However, the primary focus of this question is on the information provided in field E), which gives the specific times and dates for each instance of GNSS unavailability. The correct answer is based on the details in field E), where it clearly indicates that GBAS is unavailable on January 3, 2019, from 17:35 UTC to 17:46 UTC. While the dates in fields B) and C) do not align and appear to be remnants from a previous or test version of the NOTAM, the expectation is for students to rely on the operational details provided in field E). As a result, the question remains valid, and the correct answer is as stated.
Updating this question could make it more consistent, but it might also cause confusion for students if the original question appears as shown here.

  Comment: guys i found the easiest formula that u can use for any of these questions

ws x sin (angle between wind and true heading) x 60 / TAS
- Name: zeymahse
  Comment: @ Lukas150152 Drift is how much you are drifting due to wind, and WCA(wind correction angle) is how much you have to correct in order to stop the drifting. They are the same but OPPOSITE number and are NOT the same thing.

ex. If you are drifting 8° left due to wind coming from your right (you are 271° and the wind is coming from 340°) , like in this case, that 8°L is your DRIFT.
Your WCA will also be 8° but to the right, so opposite, to correct for it, so WCA is 8°R.

NOTE: That WCA will not bring you back to your track, the one that you are drifting away from, it will only stop you from drifting FURTHER away.

  Comment: Guys if you do it with your CRP5,

remember you will have 8 DEGREE to the LEFT, BUT this is your DRIFT !!

WCA Wind Correction Angle is inverted, so, 8 degree right, and you can read aprox 127 of GS:

  Comment: it's possible to work it out mathematically which is more accurate and for those who don't like using crp-5.

1. work out the hdg:

wind correction angle = v x sin wa x 60/tas =
= 20 x sin (340-271) x 60/135 = 8 degrees

as the wind is coming from the right, the correction will be to the right. so 8r. and the hdg = track (271) + 8 = 279 degrees.

2. work out the gs:

first work out wind component using the new heading:

wc = v x cos wa = 20 x cos (340-279) = 10kts

so gs = tas - wc = 135 - 10 = 127kts

hope this helps.

(although as someone pointed out, if you use pure logic you don't need to work anything out. the wind is coming from the right, so the wca must be right hand. that's 2 possible answers. and it is a headwind, so the gs must be less than the tas. that leaves only 1 answer. still, it's worth knowing and using the formulas for questions that are not so straight forward)

  Comment: No need to use the flight computer. Wind is coming from the right, 70 degrees from your HDG. So you must steer the aircraft to the right side in order to keep the desired track. Only 2 answers remaining. It is clear this is a headwind, so the GS MUST be lower than TAS. Save time.

- Name: iPhil
  Comment: Interesting - Concerning Answer A you say "A waypoint on a low altitude IFR chart is not relevant to a VFR point." Guys flying around VFR usually use some kind off APP such as Skydemon, Foreflight etc. and if you fly in areas with only a few references (for examples longer stretch over the sea) thats the only ones you can find and also exactly what you end up doing. You even put them in your VFR flight plan. I agree that from a formal point of view IFR has nothing to do with VFR but in reality thats the only solution that works.
- Name: VoyaAF
  Comment: Had a similar question but here are the answers France DGAC

A. Name of a waypoint on a low altitude route used for IFR flight plans.
B. Bearing and distance from an existing significant point or insertion of coordinates.
C. Name of a conspicuous city in the vicinity of the route and bearing and distance from there.
D. Coordinates of the reference point of an aerodrome and bearing and distance to the significant VFR point
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @VoyaAF, thanks for the feedback! We have updated the available options accordingly.
- Name: nickname1
  Comment: Dont we have a contradiction with 335522 here?

332582
How do you determine the position of a significant VFR waypoint for insertion into a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) flight plan?
=> By using the distance and bearing from an existing significant point or using coordinates.
(Incorrect: By inserting the coordinates of the airport reference point, then bearing and distance from it.)

335522
You want to plan a VFR flight within a controlled airspace using your GNSS flight plan as a back-up navigation method. Which of the following are best suited as significant points for entering into your GNSS flight plan as VFR waypoints using a distance and bearing?
=> Airport reference point.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello @nickname1, thank you for your comment. First of all, the first paragraph of the explanation of question 335522 explains why the airport reference point option is correct in that question.
"The question is poorly worded as none of the answers in this question fit the criteria for visual fix points that can be defined by a distance and bearing from a known point, nor are they suitable as known points for creating a distance and bearing to a VFR waypoint. The only possible known point for defining a VFR waypoint via bearing and distance is the airport reference point (ARP)."
In Question 332582, one of the reasons why the option related to the airport reference point is not correct is that it is not mentioned that a significant VFR waypoint can also be inserted by entering its coordinates.

I had this one but the option instead of being "and inserting coordinates" it was "or inserting coordinates"

You could use actually a IFR point from the gps coordinates as long as it is coinciding or maybe in the vicinity say 0.5nm of that vfr point, instead of trying to input long coordinates, specially when doing on a garmin 530 or even older, is not that easy :)).

2. Minimum (Contingency burned)

The choice of wording is NOT LESS, which means they are looking for MINIMUM, which is ALTERNATE + FINAL as we consider CONTINGENCY gone.

  Comment: For colleagues who are confused and are asking why we don't subtract the taxi fuel as well, beside all of the masses mentioned, the answer is pretty straight forward: When we say"Take Off Mass" we say everything we have, and are ready to depart. Therefore we burnt already the taxi fuel, so it's not there anymore. So there's no need to subtract something you just don't have. Hope it helps :) . Cheers.

Question Number: AT00287
- Name: Giadina
  Comment: Pay attention: In EASA doc.965\2012 ( CAT.OP.MPA.305 Commencement and continuation of approach
) it's explicit that you can technically commence any approach also with 0 RVR, it doesn't matter for COMMENCE.
Of course you cannot proceed if you don't reach the RVR minum at 1000ft AGL or DH\MDH if lower.

So, regarding this question: if one of the options is 85m, this would be the correct one...
- Name: AndyT
  Comment: There is obviously poor use of the English language here. The word "ANY" infers that you have to be able to achieve both, whereas the word EITHER would infer that you can choose the lowest. In this case if you have an RVR of 200m you can NOT take ANY of the approaches, you are limited to 11-1A. If you have an RVR of 550m then you CAN take ANY of the approaches.
- Name: JdjCanFly2
  Comment: Special Aircrew and Aircraft Certification required for CAT II/III according to 11-1A. There is no information about meeting the aircrew requirements in this question so how can we assume 200m RVR is acceptable? Appeal.

Please correct me if I misunderstand something here!
- Name: Fern14
  Comment: There is no minimum RVR to legally commence an approach in EASA, unless I am wrong (NCC 230 and commercial 305 I think). But you cannot continue below 1000 ft above AAE if RVR is not reported as per the chart RVR. So technically, in this question, we can commence the approach, we just cannot continue the approach if RVR stays below 200 m for CAT III.
- Name: MissAviatrix
  Comment: I also had that similar question about electrical failure on (Stuttgart 11-1). It said you are being radar vectored down to 4000ft when electricity stops working, what altitude are you gonna stay at? Youre in radial 250 I believe.
Options were 4000ft MSL (thats also what you were cleared to before electricity stopped working), 3900, ILS 1467 and one more option.

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Nmaca64, thank you for your feedback. This situation seems a bit complicated. Because if we assume that the answer is 1200 m, the question needs to ask about the ILS approach on the 11-1 chart and specify the “ALS out” status. If the question asks for the minimum RVR for CAT D aircraft, the answer should be 200 m based on the 11-1A chart.
We kindly ask anyone who encounters this question on official exams to let us know so we can add a new question. Thanks in advance.

  Comment: any? with rvr200 i cannot do any of the two. just one. is it a grammar problem or what?
question should be, what is the minimum rvr to be able to perform at least one of the two procedures?
- Name: Skyturtle
  Comment: The word ANY means in the context of this question, that a crew can elect to perform either of the two presented approaches. So the lowest RVR value that could satisfy both cases, given the aircraft equipment capability, is RVR 550 m.
RVR200 m would not satisfy the visibility requirements of CAT II nor for CAT I - LOC for rwy 07.
This question, presented as is, should be appealed.

  Comment: @legoland ah im an absolute idiot, thank you for reminding me i completely forgot to account to turn course into heading, cheers mate
- Name: legoland
  Comment: All you guys who got 108 on CRP-5 just don't use course properly.

For GS on CRP-5 you need True Heading. But got CRS and CRS+V=TT. So from that you need to find TH first before even you could read GS from CRP5

Steps as follows
1) Blue (middle) pointer to TAS = 125
2) With pencil make a mark for W/V - so turn HDG 240 and mark 30 below blue pointer (95 mark)
3) Turn Inner scale to TrueTrack = CouRSe + variation => 205-15=190
4) now read where pencil mark dot points in the wind scale = 12. wind is from the right so you have to add 12 so that means MH=202
5) inner scale to mh=202 and just now you can read ground speed which is 102

now back to the formula nam=tas/ngm/gs = 125x57/102 =69,853 which is the correct answer

be aware of these tricky q and pay attention to what exactly the give you as input data

- Name: Jellows
  Comment: Think about the Course as a Track. Once you have tuned 190 (True track) on the CRP5 you get 13 degrees drift to the left, if you compensate for this and use a WCA you end up at a heading of 201 (True HDG) and a drift of 11 degrees left (=190 True track). This gives you almost 104 k GS!

  Comment: Two important things to understand to answer this question. 1) Unless specifically stated or given by ATC or ATIS, wind is in TRUE. 2) For those saying they get 108 GS on the CRP-5, remember that the CRP5 is like a formula. If you put the wrong information in, you will get the wrong information out. The CRP5 asks for HEADING, not TRACK. So you must find the actual heading of the aircraft, you cannot just put 190 at the top because that is the track

  Comment: Save yourself the time of reading through the silly debate here and read none but this!

This Question is 100% legit. You have been given a course to correct, not a heading as only a few people here have realised. So you must also correct for drift, doing so will give you a GS of 104 using the CRP-5. And after subbing in the values into the NGM/GS = NAM/TAS formula, you will get bang on 68.509615 on your calculator.

Indepth:
1.We use the mark down method always on CRP-5, anything else is wrong.
2.This is because you need to use the bottom of the card (wind section) to accurately mark the wind.
3.So put the blue TAS dot on 0 and mark down the wind of 30kts ensuring you have the wind heading of 240 aligned under the black arrow.
4.Now slide the card so your blue TAS dot is over 125kts.
5.Understand that we are drifting 11deg left, so to correct spin the wheel 11 degrees to the right which will put the black arrow above 201deg
6.Now that we are on track, you'll see the GS is in fact 104kts
7.Now use the NGM/GS = NAM/Tas

  Comment: Tips if you are using formula (w. speed * cos(w. angle)), you will almost always get an answer that is slightly lower than the EASA answer so you will end up dead in the middle of two alternatives. From what ive seen, if you just bump it up slightly in the answer (In this question, by bumping it by half a NM or 1NM, from 67,397 to 68,397) then you will find the right answer.

BTW this also works with distance questions on ED-4 by using the pizza cutter/PJ-1 Plotter. GL

- Name: TheAngryMan
  Comment: None of the above. Useless. Surely the only course in the world that actively discourages the use of maths, and the 100% accuracy that comes with it. There is a 19kt headwind component, not 21kt, meaning the ground speed is 106kt, not 104 etc etc. This means the actual answer is 67.4 - bang in the middle of two answers. If I was calculating my crosswind component in a light aircraft, those two knots would very easily put me outside of limits.

  Comment: Why you use two different methods for the crp5 wind calculation? if you drawn the 30 knots line below 125 knots of TAS with 240 ahead and then you rotate the wheel to 190 the line end go on the bow corresponding to 108 kt of GS that gets you exactly to 66 NAM. You cannot use every time a different method and put in the answers a value so close to the right one, the difference between 68.5 and 66 was minimum and they are get both from a correct method using the flight computer, so at least put just one of them, cause we can literally not know which method are you going to use
- Name: andre2175
  Comment: You need to correct for drift. At first you put 190 on your true heading, but you need to correct to the right due to drift. Your course is 190 and heading roughly 202, thats when you read your ground speed, being around 102/104.

  Comment: Hi Rhys! Affirm. The question I found in the oficial exam (SENASA Madrid, Spain) was like in the question bank, stating ISA-10 and without any information about the altitude of the weather station from which QNH data was taken. Anyway, I chose FL290 like here, but he correct answer was FL310. If we make temperature correction for the small air column (from the top of the obstacle to the aircraft) we could use FL290 because this level gives more than 2000ft obstacle clearance. But if we apply correction assuming the total air column (from MSL to the aircraft) we cannot use FL290 anymore. We need FL300, but as the magnetic track is 130, in RVSM airspace we must choose FL310.
Hope it clarifies my previous comment! Best of luck.
- Name: JesusPilot1996
  Comment: hi everyone!
yesterday i was in senasa and i found this particular question, exactly as described here but instead of isa+10 it was isa-10, and i answered fl290 (option b) assuming that meteorological station was at the top of the obstacle (26500ft). so i added 300ft for pressure correction (28500+300) and subtract (28800-26500=2300) to obtain the air column for me to calculate temperature correction. i did this way:
0.004 x 2300 x 10 = 92ft, so we need 28500 + 300 for pressure correction + 92 for temp correction = 28892ft for 2000ft obstacle clearance, so i answered fl290 because it adheres to moc requirements.
as i said, fl290 was option b, so before finish the exam i remembered that option a was fl310 and option b was fl290. finally, the correct one was fl310 (a). i can confirm that 100%. it is most likely that they assume the temperature correction was for total air column (from msl to 28800ft) so: 0.004 x 28800 x 10 = 1152ft
to this we must to add 300ft for pressure correction, so the total correction = 1452ft.
28500 + 1452 = 29952ft (we cannot use fl290, instead the next available fl would be fl310).
conclusion: this happens because the question is incomplete, so you have to assume (as always) where meteorological station is. in this particular question, if you found it in the official exam, i can confirm that they assume the total air column from msl.
good lack for you all guys!!

  Comment: Hello everyone, thank you for your valuable comments and feedback! Taking into consideration the information you've shared, we have generated a new question that can be found at reference number 331470. However, if the data remains unchanged from what was provided here, the correct option should be FL280 instead of FL300.
Furthermore, we have made updates to the explanation for this question. Please take note of this from our team:
"We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL).
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support."

  Comment: Assume that the station is at MSL. The result is that we have to fly at 27360ft, then applying the IFR rule (odd in this case) we have to fly at FL290. In my opinion the explanation is not correct

  Comment: Hi guys! I am very sorry for these inconsistencies, I understand how frustrating it is, however they come from EASA, not us. We are trying to figure out how the examiners are solving these questions. To be honest, I think some of these questions are created by different examiners who use different methods to solve these sort of exercises, which makes it difficult to understand whether they consider that the aerodrome/meteo station is at the top of the obstacle, or not. The learning objectives (please see below) clearly state that the temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the ground and the position of the aircraft. Therefore, if the "obstacle" they refer to is a mountain, and not an isolated obstacle, the correction should be applied to the layer between the obstacle and the aircraft.
All I can suggest is that you leave a comment in your exam.

  Comment: EASA LOs:
State that the 4 per cent-rule can be used to calculate true altitude from indicated altitude, and also indicated altitude from true altitude (not precise but sufficient due to the approximation of the 4 per cent-rule.)
Remark: The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
a. All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
b. The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 700 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
c. To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 per cent-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4 per cent for each 10 deg C temperature deviation from ISA.
d. If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be constantly the same given value in the whole layer.
e. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the ground and the position of the aircraft.

  Comment: I got it right BUT the question does not sys that the meteo station is on top of the mountain, so why would I apply the temp correction to just 2000ft? I can not read the examiners mind and know that he meant that.
- Name: RaphaelN
  Comment: Actually with this question, we can find the correct answer with out being told if the met met station is at sea level or on the mountain.
Since we know that the track is 130 in RVSM airspace, the only flight levels in the answers can be 290 and 310.
- Temp correction with met station on the top of the mountain: 28720 ft
- Temp correction with met station at sea level: 27660 ft

  Comment: @hannes2511 Friednly tip so you do not waste time when you don't have to.
For TrueT use a plotter and eventually take into account the VAR with the CDMVT rule if asked for the MagT.
If there is a scale somewhere on the chart like here on the right side of it, USE IT. Don't waste time calculating departure, also, because probably, the examiner used the scale too and you'll get an answer that is more close to what he got, which is, also, the answer that he put as the correct one.
Btw, I tried the GNav departure formula for curiosity and I am also getting almost 24NM instead of 33NM.

- Name: CaptainRawgood
  Comment: for questions which start with imperial, multiply by specific gravity and compare the results, you'll get the right one every time
for questions which start with pounds, divide by specific gravity and disregard the comma, you'll get there too:
in example:
670 * 0.78 = 522.6 -> 5226 lb is the answer
865 / 0.81 = 1067.90 -> 107 IG is the answer
- Name: javigv
  Comment: 1 Imp. Gal. = 4.54 Litres
1kg = 2.205 lbs
SG:
Litres to Kg -> multiply
Kg to Litres-> divide

So in this case:
670IG x 4,546 = 3046 litres
3046 litres x 0,78 = 2376kg
2376 kg x 2,205 = 5239lb

  Comment: It's possible to work it out mathematically which is more accurate and for those who don't like using crp-5.

1. Work out the HDG:

Wind Correction Angle = V x sin WA x 60/TAS =
= 20 x sin (340-270) x 60/135 = 8 degrees

As the wind is coming from the right, the correction will be to the right. So the HDG = Track (270) + 8 = 278 degrees.

2. Work out the GS:

First work out wind component using the new heading:

WC = V x cos WA = 20 x cos (340-278) = 9kts

so GS = TAS - WC = 135 - 9 = 126Kts

3. Work out time: 53NM/126kts = 0.42 = 25min

4. Add up accumulated times:

23+25+4 = 52min

Hope this helps.

  Comment: Similar format q in Latvian CAA today, only 2 answers with 10-3C and 2 with 10-3P, and there was an explanation together with each answer. Cant remember incorrect ones but i chose the answer '10-3P, as rnav system must be used in combination with VOR to act as a backup.' Sorry for vagueness.

  Comment: its not that question, it was this question and the options similar to this but it said
a) 10-3P the aircraft only needs to have GPS installed and RNAV approved
B) 10-3P the airfcraft needs to have GPS and the conventional radio aids working (or something similar)

answer was "the FMC is unable to adjust for the increase in fuel burn so fuel calculation is not precise"

Something very close to that.
- Name: Oli91
  Comment: A, B & D are covered in definition of contingency fuel.

Question Number: AT00303
- Name: Danimira05
  Comment: Okay, yes we do not need two alternates so there is no requirement to bring the fuel for the furthest one but still if the operator wants us to pick two alternates then we need to bring the fuel for the furthest alternate otherwise which is the purpose of planning another alternate that you will never be able to reach without using part of the final reserve. I understand the law but this question and answers are out of any logic and reality
- Name: George8264
  Comment: What happened to carrying the more amount of the two?
- Name: Teekee
  Comment: I understand the logic of the explanation leading to that result, however I don't understand why they elect 2 alternates in the first place if you can't reach one ? that's not even a trap, that's misleading on purpose to make you fail. At what point during our career are we going to elect Sydney as an alternate while flying from London to NYC ?
Question should have been phrased differently to test our knowledge of the number of alternates required. It's disgusting.
- Name: carlotahmello
  Comment: By regulation, under the present weather situation, two alternates were not required. But since the operator, by its only decision, decided to file for two alternates it must comply with the regulation that says fuel to the furthest away.

  Comment: No need to calculate take the lowest one but the value just above the lowest one

- Name: ThomasVDB
  Comment: I got confused between the criteria for taking 1 alternate and the criteria for taking 2. 2 alternates are required only when forecast weather at the destination at ETA+- 1hr is below planning minima or the info is unavailable. The conditions given here, notably the 4km visibility mean that 1 alternate is required but not 2.
- Name: adamb
  Comment: Seen UK CAA (04 Dec 24) it was a type in and asked for fuel to get to either alternate. I went with 2060.
- Name: CharlieN

1) Plot on the graph

2) if question asks to:

find the required Alternate Fuel -> answer is the bigger number

the operator nominated two alternate airports. the pilot can choose which one to plan for the flight. what is the most suitable alternate and how much fuel is needed to reach it?

  Comment: UK CAA Very same numbers and values but the question stated both alternates need to be reached so went with the higher number
- Name: Zacch
  Comment: Had this question UKCAA, exact same figures but Im almost 100% sure it mentioned the operator wanting both alternates to be reachable, making the answer 2100 instead
- Name: RajHamsaXAir
  Comment: I dont get it. The regulations say you should carry the fuel for the alternate which requires the most amount of it. Period.
- Name: FutureHendrix

- Name: mevrick
  Comment: Leonardo the operator has NOMINATED two alternates. The weather being above minima, you CHOOSE the best suitable alternate between the two, the nearest, which also requires the lowest amount of fuel.
- Name: Leo03
  Comment: Selecting the lowest fuel makes absolutely no sense. If I do not have enough fuel to go there, why select two alternates? There may be no legal reason to do so, but if I select an alternate I must have enough fuel to go there, even if it is my second alternate.
- Name: 747Maverick
  Comment: am I right to say that if during the pre-flight planning the weather at destination is good and at or above minima, we legally do not need to have a second alternate. Which is why in this case, we chose the fuel required to the first alternate. However, if during the pre-flight planning, the weather at destination is below minima, then we have to plan for a second alternate, and we take the higher fuel required between the first and second alternate? The confusion here is because Question 339797 states we have to take the higher of the two, while in this question, we took the lower of the two. So let me know if my theory is correct which I believe will help the others here a lot as well. Thanks.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello @Titus! The question states that meteorological information is available and that weather conditions are expected to be above the planning minima. There's no legal reason to have 2 alternates. The operator has nominated 2 alternates, however that is not required by law in these circumstances. Therefore, in this case, you choose the one that requires less fuel. I hope this makes sense!
- Name: CptJedMarshall
  Comment: The CAA have confirmed the answer is indeed 1900kg and this was confirmed via BGS. ''Whilst the CAA agree the question could be better worded i.e. There are 2 Alternates available NOT The Operator has nominated 2 Alternates, it is not a legal requirement to use Alt 2 because the weather does not require it.'' I hope this helps all future exam takers.
- Name: Flapless
  Comment: Disagree. 1. The planning minima has a 5km requirement. The question states 4km. So you cant be above the minima.
2. As my instructor advised, if an operator nominates 2 alternates then you must take fuel for the furthest. Please can you add a snip of this law you are referring to, to the explanation please. Thanks
- Name: Flapless
  Comment: 2100kg is the answer. Confirmed by a BGS instructor.

Reasoning:

Basically, a Dest alt is required but not 2 destination alts, as per the WX rules below.
However, the Q states that the Operator has nominated 2 Alt and although you technically only need one Alt, If 2 Alts have been nominated then you must carry fuel for the furthest / greatest Alt Fuel required.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Joshua! As I have said previously, the question states that meteorological information is available and that weather conditions are expected to be above the planning minima. There's no legal reason to have 2 alternates. The operator has nominated 2 alternates, however that is not required by law in these circumstances. Therefore, in this case, you choose the one that requires less fuel. I hope this makes sense!
Regarding the correct option being 2 100 kg, we have not received any feedback confirming such assumption. If anyone comes across this question, please share your experience. Thank you!
- Name: Flapless
  Comment: Turns out this question is much uglier than I thought. So you do not need an alternate if:
1. Trip is less than 6hrs. 2. Dest has 2 runways. 3. WX at dest ETA +/- 1 hour; Cloud base 2000ft or circling minimum+500ft, whichever greater, and visibility of 5km or more.

Question states 4km visibility, so we still require 2 right? It actually doesn't meet the weather criteria?
- Name: Flapless
  Comment: please can you include a snip of the applicable "law" everyone is referring to for this question please? Many thanks!
- Name: Flapless
  Comment: Also, I'd like to add.. consider an 8 hour flight. We look up the TAF during planning phase and the weather is all good. You are 4 hours in to flight and the weather is now worse than forecast. What happens then? You are still happy with 1 alternate, or should you theoretically have 2? This is a planning exam, so surely you would plan for worst case?

As you can tell.. very frustrated with this question!
- Name: Flapless
  Comment: Seen UK CAA - went for 2050kg. Was always told to take the largest alternate fuel. The law won't be there to save you when you want to fly to alternate B instead of A but there we go.
So pissed off I've seen this now lol.

- Name: EASAfammocc
  Comment: Guys if you have doubts on why we select the lower of the two, scroll down and check out atp lq comment
- Name: Lauren
  Comment: please refer to @nelli comment, why is this not the case?
- Name: Nelli
  Comment: basic procedure states that in case of two alternates fuel must be sufficient to proceed to the aerodrome that requires the greater amount of fuel. so why is the lower acceptable ?
- Name: Nathan
  Comment: For conditions given, minimum of 1 alternate is legally required. Therefore for this question, the minimum alternate fuel will be the lowest of the fuel to EITHER alternates and so answer = 1900kg. IF conditions were that a minimum 2 alternates were required, then alternate fuel required would have to be sufficient to fly to BOTH alternates if needed and so would be the greater of two = 2100kg.

  Comment: they say find the minimum not the lowest so the minimum is 2100 .
- Name: Hassib
  Comment: If weather at destination is above planning minima (+- 1 hour ETA) then logically its not required to nominate two alternates, so in order to carry less fuel and more payload we select one alternate which is suitable and close to destination. Thank you!

  Comment: I feel offended by the way, someone is just playing with your mind.

  Comment: Hey guys! This is a tricky one I must admit. They ask for the frequeny of the navaid to the east of SIERRA. TGO is definitely to the east whereas SGD could be considered north of SIERRA.
- Name: Jon
  Comment: @Giovanni, Paul explains it already correctly, but FYI VHF comms are only 118 - 136,975 MHz, so 115,45 MHz cannot be CTR freq.
108-112 MHz = terminal VOR & ILS
112 - 117,950 MHz = VOR
118 - 136,975 MHz = comms
You can use that to directly recognize what a frequency is (and what it cannot be).

- Name: Lafiq
  Comment: Time B to C = 5 min
Planned B to C = 1222-1178 =44 kg
Actual B to C = 1205-1155=50 kg

Planned B to C = 44 kg : 5 min = 8.8 L/min = 528 L/h
Actual B to C = 50 kg : 5 min = 10L/min = 600L/h

600 - 528 =72 L/h increase
- Name: Jahfarkazmi
  Comment: Simple method.

Planned B - Planned C = 44
Actual B - Actual C = 50

(5/60) for the 5 mins in the question.

44 / (5/60) = 528 (planned)
50 / (5/60) = 600 (actual)

So we have a 72kg increase.

  Comment: found the same as @thepilotg in austro San Marino. The question asked why in one chart the difference between NGM e NAM was bigger than the other. I can't remember the answers very well, but the but one of the answers stated that it was because they had different flight times, another answer stated that the flight logs were wrong, another that the difference between tas and gs was smaller in the first chart.

  Comment: NEW QUESTION, same as @rui
I saw this Annex at LBA in germany. They had 2 of these flight plans, both flights had the same wind component, one flight was from A to B and the other flight from C to D with different distances. The difference btw. Ground Miles and Air Miles were different and they asked why that could be, because both have the same wind component. There was no cruising level given.. One answer was because of the smaller difference in TAS and GS I think, which I chose (same as @rui answer) The ISA devitation was given, for the fist flight ISA+3 and for the other ISA-6

please add the question, it is a hard one an will help the other

  Comment: SAME POLAND 15/03/2024
but instead of this correct answer I got the answer was something about that the difference between air distance and ground distance is because of an average 11 kt tailwind over the 8h 37m long flight. And other answer said something about the G/C distance is a great circle distance which doesn't take account for SIDs and approaches.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello everyone, many thanks for your insightful feedback! It's possible that the data presented in the annex differed, leading to the occurrence of tailwind instead of headwind.

- Name: muadib25
  Comment: Dear EASA, according to the graph, we have to reduce our TOM to 67500kg, not 68000kg! Therefore, our Extra Fuel that can be carried is 709kg. So, no answer is correct but we take the closest one.
- Name: Banaan
  Comment: Type in version of this question. Exact wording. Seen UKCAA 12/5/25
- Name: Lander
  Comment: I'll try to make my point more clear why this Q is unsolveable.

Maximum mass on take off will be (68T). (ignoring the wrong chart)
AZFM will be 59031Kg.
-- sutracting 68 000 - 59 031 = 8969kg (this is the amount of fuel MAX that we can carry)

Now they give us a "min block fuel". But we will need contingency, alternate, additional,.. But we have no way to calculate those.
If we sutract the trip fuel from the 8969kg (max fuel to be carried), we get 4205kg.

Those 4205kg will include alternate, contingency, etc. Without knowing those values , I cannot get the MAX amount of extra fuel..!

It's difficult to explain, but see, "min block fuel" does not mean you can just say "ah so my taxi+trip+cont+additional+.. = 8000kg" . NO ! Block fuel even includes "EXTRA fuel" so this makes this question even more outrageous !

REPORT and please, UPDATE the explanation of this Q ! This question is wrong in the roots. This should be appealed !
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Lander, the limitation is based on the take-off mass, so the taxi fuel should be deducted from your calculation. The question provides a minimum block fuel of 8000 kg, which, based on the wording, I interpret as not including discretionary fuel (formerly known as extra fuel), since it specifically asks you to calculate the maximum discretionary fuel that can be uplifted.That said, I don't see an issue with the question itself. However, if you strongly disagree, you're of course welcome to submit an appeal during your exam.
- Name: Lander

  Comment: @SAMITURK8

What Musto meant was the following.
If you initially ignore the graph and calculate ATOM/ALM and compare them with their respective Maximum masses you get a result of 4090kg.
This meaning there is only one possible answer left, since you wouldn't be able to fuel more.

-> additionally if you take your ATOM and compare it to the optimal mass at FL370 you would also get the required response.

EASA obviously doesn't want to make it easy but there are are ways to beat them :)

To be able to climb directly to FL370 our mass should be 68000kg (from the graph, put 37000ft go to the reference line and down)

68,000kg become the limited now.

To find the extra we need to know the difference between the most limited (68000kg) and out TOM 66791 = 1209kg that the extra fuel we can put (:

  Comment: There was no explanation so I will try.

1) Given MTOM of 76'000.
2) New goal to climb to 37'000 ft - (To do this we have to reduce our TOM. The graph allows this by starting from the Left side (y axis), going across to the right and then down, where we find approximately 68'000 kg. This is our new TOM.)
3) Calculate extra fuel using new TOM of 68'000 kg - (Next, perform the usual calculations i.e. TOM = MTOM - DOM - TL - TOF. and LM = MLM - DOM - TL - (TOF - TRIP).

The new limiting value for possible extra fuel is 1209 Kg.

- Name: YounesSebbouba
  Comment: I had this one today in FRANCE plus a new one, I can't remember perfectly the answers but the logical one was something like :

"Updated winds can be added and accurate ETA prediction and fuel remaining can be displayed or calculated", other answers were unlogical like "the fmc can automatically change route to avoid weather.."

Sorry for the unprecision I'll made my best in the upcoming exams !

Otherwise, Charts are 100% identicals aswell as 90% of the calculations, almost word for word.

But guys believe me, hard work always pay, this one is not a banky one, it requires you to be ready and knows your formulas. If you are ready, you'll read the questions in the exam with the smile.

Thanks for well preparating us and thanks to all the community for your helpful and support comments !

so
3 x 120 (Home (TAS +20kt tail wind)) / OUT (80) + HOME (120) = 1.8 hrs x 60 = 108min

1.8 hrs x 80 (gs out) = 144nm

  Comment: When operating a flight without selecting a destination alternate, you will ALWAYS need to load 15 minutes of holding fuel to protect your final reserve from a go around/missed approach at the dest`n (vehicles enters RW when you are on very short final?).

  Comment: Hi @Sara, I understand your question. Personally, I would still calculate the value using the fuel flow provided by the question. I know that in some cases, that is not done. That is purely because we consider the correct option marked in the exam. It's honestly difficult to forecast what EASA will want because it seems that some exercises are solved differently, and I believe that's because they're coming from different examiners. Unfortunately, those discrepancies are coming from EASA and there's nothing we can do to fix it.

  Comment: It’s 45 mins + 15% for isolated AD isnt it? But if there’s no alternate available then it’s 45 minutes plus 15 mins? @atplquestions could you justify this please?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi guys, thank you for your comments! 
You are referring to the isolated aerodrome procedure. In such cases, for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, the alternate and final fuel reserve required to the nearest adequate destination alternate aerodrome is more than fuel to fly for 45 minutes plus 15 % of the flying time planned to be spent at cruising level or two hours, whichever is less => as you have correctly stated. However, this question does not state the use of an isolated aerodrome, instead it only says that no alternate has been selected, therefore, according to the regulation in the explanation, the following rule should apply:
The minimum additional fuel, which should permit holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.

Anyhow, if anyone who comes across this question could provide further feedback, it would be highly appreciated. 🙂

  Comment: Again, if they ask for an "IDEAL" situation, once you arrive at DEST. you should have *final reserve + alternate + contingency.* The less fuel we consume, the better, BUT, in REALITY and by LAW, the MINIMUM amount of fuel that is required, by law, to have on-board at DEST. is the *final reserve + alternate.*
At ALT. only *final reserve* is required by law. You'd have already consumed the alternate fuel and, since you have done at least 1 go-around, you'd also have consumed some contingency at least.

Read the question carefully as, apparently, that is the skill they want (need??) us to master.

  Comment: Hi everyone,

I am a bit confused as to when the temperature correction is first and then pressure correction or vice versa (ref. for instance question 334872 (let's ignore the part on the semi-circular rule)). Both questions ask for true altitude, but the order changes in theexplanation.. And this can have a large impact on the result. Anyone could explain the logic? Not confused on wether to add or subtract values, just the order in which we apply the corrections (perhaps depending on the situation?)..

  Comment: Damn this confusing wording. The biggest challenge of this subject is to understand the statement..
- Name: Luke
  Comment: Yeah wording is poor. The current phrasing suggests that you need to work out what the true altitude of the MOCA is, adjusting for temperature and pressure, to see what FL will meet it. But, what the question is actually asking should be worded as "What is your true altitude, in order to check you are meeting the MOCA?"
- Name: Christopher
  Comment: If the MOCA is the lowest we can go, then why are we working this out using the FL and not the MOCA?

All we seem to be doing here is working out how to maintain the FL.

Unless they are just asking for the True Altitude we are currently at so that we can know how far we can descend at still maintain the MOCA. If so, the wording is poor here.

Question Number: AT00321
- Name: Christian59
  Comment: It's not 2 correct answers, because the fuel consumption will not be less on the leg back to Athen. Doesn't make any difference from where the fuel is, the airplane should be as heavy as planned on this particular leg. I get that it's confusing because the reference "less than..." is stated nowhere and it makes you think "less then on the previous leg", but you need to assume in reference to the same leg. You could argue if one answer would have said that the fuel consumption would be higher on the leg to Paris, but it's not the case here.
- Name: Vladyboi
  Comment: such a technicality, these guys have one job and they're terrible. Since you don't know the weight in the return than MAYBE the airplane is heavier. For example you took 10 passengers and no cargo from athens to paris and 300 and full cargo back. This might result in the airplane being heavier back and consuming more BUT, if at the return it consumes more it also burns more CO2, so Fuel consumption and CO2 emission go hand in hand so they are absolutely both true. If you increase one, the other increases as well

Now, after the exam, I understand that SFC could be lower but the actual consumption has to be calculated since we do not know the weight on the way back. We may end up even havier. Perhaps, it's the correct one only because it's technically the more correct one. Idk.

  Comment: Seen in Vienna today. Some of the other answers where slightly changed and the answer with CO2 was the only one that made sense
- Name: FraBal97
  Comment: I think the assumption behind the answer is that we don’t know what the winds are so we cannot automatically assume one leg will consume more fuel than the other.
- Name: Frosties
  Comment: Ok Greta but we will still consume less on the way back relatively speaking.
The only way to exclude the other answer is to assume they compare to a normal flight (without tankering), not to the first flight (with tankering).

  Comment: Why not
The fuel consumption will be less from Paris to Athens
- Name: Eagle1
  Comment: "less", less than what?
- Name: vayasable
  Comment: ULC Poland 11/10/2024. Everybody saying that the fuel consumption from Paris to Athens is less - you don't know the traffic load for both legs so you can't be sure about that. Only the CO2 answer is correct.
- Name: Taiga
  Comment: @HadiK the mass is the same when flying back to Athens as if you'd refueled in Paris
And you are heavier than "planned" from Athens to Paris.
- Name: HadiK
  Comment: Who gives a damn of CO2 emissions, Why is less fuel consumption wrong? Less mass, less drag, less fuel. This is flight planning ffs, What am I missing?!
- Name: Justus1
  Comment: Ok, From Athen to Paris our plane is heavier -> Thus resulting in more fuel consumption and therefore more CO2 emissions. But on the flight back form Paris to Athen, our plane is lighter, due to the Fuel burnt and therefore Our fuel consumption should be less, shouldnt it?? I see 2 correct answers here..
- Name: AlkisLikos
  Comment: Heavier so fuel consumptin increases, but since we are in 2024 that translates to C02 emission increase
- Name: Papa777x
  Comment: New ECQB2024 question and of course EASA an EU came with this CO2 emissions bullshit
- Name: Sebastien
  Comment: All the comments below are true if you consider are comparing the first to the second leg. However given the options I think the examiner wants to compare the increased fuel tankering scenario with a normal leg by refueling in Paris (option for weight gives this indication). In fact we are only carrying extra fuel for the leg to Paris but the leg back to Athens we have a normal weight compared to what we would have without tankering, thus the fuel consumption is the same as planned (since the weight is the same as the planned weight).

Yes the fuel consumption of the first leg is more than the leg back to Athens, but it is the same as the planned fuel consumption if you refuelled in Paris, making C the fully correct answer. Also we don't know the payload for both legs so the fuel comsuption could theoritically be the same or higher.
- Name: AlexPersiani
  Comment: Since we carry more fuel from Athens to Paris the aircraft will be heavier and consume more fuel compared to an aircraft without the tankering (infact in other exercises we add the fuel penality) In conclusion the fuel consumption will be less from Paris to Athens should be correct since the aircraft is lighter. Can you calrify this for me?
- Name: Slyuosmaz
  Comment: But from Paris to Athens you should have less fuel consumption then from Athens to Paris as you were much heavier and now you are lighter so less fuel consumption.. Appealable

- Name: Behrouzmeshgin
  Comment: in case of divert pilot should be have 40+30 min fuel to reach alternate with remaining final reserved fuel
if wants to hold just 10 min could be in hold
- Name: klappan
  Comment: Declaring minimums is incorrect because you still have a legal option to divert, and it won't 'guarantee' any special treatment.
Hold for 10, hope for the best, communicate your concerns to ATC, and then divert when it's legally required.
- Name: Marko
  Comment: @URIRO Approach is included in the trip fuel, which is not mentioned here, but of course assumed to be still intact if no approach has been flown yet.

  Comment: Lets say I'm holding for 10 minutes above destination aerodorme. After that, I decide to land at destination as it says in the answer for the qustion. I'm approaching the runway and decide to proceed go around due to unstable approach.
In this case, I dont have enough fuel to go to alternate, I burned fuel doring the approach after the hold and I'm about to use Final Reserve fuel
- Name: CarloRomaFlyPe
  Comment: May be i Understand about the land at destination

the delay is only expected but its not sure so the commander has to try or to check if there is delay at destination
- Name: SHOKS
  Comment: Declare minimums and Guarantee words rings an alarm in last option. (As an afterthought)
Also ATC cannot ensure because it may be a blocked runway or reasons beyond ATC control
Given all this, the option to hold for 10 (or less, PIC discretion ) is most appropriate
The correct option wud have been advise ATC, that after 10 min of hold we would need positive landing clearance
If not assured of positive landing clearance- divert
- Name: NicoH
  Comment: so you are telling me that if i waste my 10 minutes of extra fuel and THEN decide to go to the alternate, i wont waste a single minute of my alternate fuel getting out of the holding patternt and placing my heading to the alternate?

this is unrealistic and dumb.

  Comment: @atplq TODAY IN HUNGARY. The correct answer IS NOT to hold for 17 min. The correct one was : HOLD FOR 10 MIN TO SEE IF THE SITUATION Changes, and if it doesnt, go to alternate. i am paraphrasing a bit but it was the one with 10 min of holding. 100 % sure
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hey everyone! Thanks a lot for all your feedback. We have updated the available options and we believe that it now resembles what you may find in your official examination. Nevertheless, any further feedback is welcome.
The LEGAL and preferred COMMERCIAL solution is option c) Hold 10 minutes to see effectively if it's a 17 minutes holding, and in case it is, proceed to the alternate, leaving the 30 minutes of final reserve fuel intact.
Option b) "Hold for 17 minutes, and after that time if landing isn't possible, proceed to alternate using the alternate fuel remaining." This scenario requires the pilots to consume 7 minutes of final reserve fuel, as they are only carrying 10 minutes of extra fuel (for holding).
Option a) "Immediately divert to the destination alternate since there is NOT sufficient fuel to hold for the estimated 17 minutes, thereby having extra fuel when landing at the destination alternate." is incorrect because diverting immediately to the alternate is not necessary since the aircraft has sufficient fuel to complete the hold and land at the destination airport A with the required fuel reserves.
Option d) "Declare minimum fuel to ATC as that will guarantee priority and ATC will ensure that the aeroplane will only hold for the available time to land with alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel." is incorrect because declaring minimum fuel is not necessary since the aircraft has sufficient fuel to complete the hold and land at the destination airport A with the required fuel reserves. Additionally, declaring minimum fuel when not actually necessary may cause unnecessary delays and concerns for the crew and ATC.
- Name: Simone
  Comment: @ATPLQ seen today in Malpensa (IT). Answer A (Immediately..) and D (Declare..) word by word as here, but for answer B the sentence is "Hold for 17 minutes, and after that time if landing isn't possible, proceed to alternate using the alternate fuel remaining" and for answer C "Hold 10 minutes to see effectively if it's a 17 minutes holding, and in case it is, commit to land (and proceed to) at the alternate leaving the 33(!) minutes of final reserve intact.
FPL passed today and bank is about 85%.
Good luck!

  Comment: Same question in Polish ULC today but without the answer to hold and then land (which is currently marked as correct). Rest of the answers were the same. Instead of this one there was something like report minimum fuel to atc which will provide priority for landing after 17min of holding. This answer was incorrect.

- Name: Onder034
  Comment: Again word by word austro. Correct option was the same with additional info something like: hold for 17 min and commit to land at the destination. After 17 minutes if you cant land you need to divert and be sure land with final reserve fuel intact.
- Name: Nuuyoma
  Comment: Seen in Austro but the correct option was not available, instead this option was available :Hold for 10 minutes to assess whether the delay is realistic and, if it is, commit to landing ay airport A with final reserve and 33 minutes of fuel for further unseen circumstances.
- Name: Amin
  Comment: @ATPLQ Sweden today but 'heavily' re-worded, same concept! They Informed you that you have 18 liters additional fuel onboard on your way to your destination, with an alternate. ATC informs you that there are delays for the STARs to the airport. The delay is estimated to 12 liters, What should the commander do?

Correct answer was to hold and use 12 liters of additional fuel and commit to land with plan/intention to keep Final reserve and alternate fuel on board intact. Very easy otherwise.
- Name: Nikodimos
  Comment: The questions asks for the legal and COMMERCIAL answer. If you divert after some time you will burn extra fuel waiting for nothing and then your airline will have to pay extra money for the diversion fuel and also for the passengers because they did not land in the original destination. From a commercial prospective diverting or even worse waiting and then diverting are the worst financial decisions. Declaring fuel mayday is illegal so the only one left that make sense is wait for landing in the original destination. Good luck

  Comment: 1. Find wind ( heading 90 - wind velocity 90 = 0) It means direct head wind, so you use 30kt to find groundspeed home/out
2. Groundspeed home (TAS 210 + 30 = 240) and Groundspeed out (TAS 210 - 30 = 180)
3. (DISTANCE * GSH) / (GSO + GSH) = xx
So like this --> (360 * 240) / (180+240) = 205.7 or 206NM

  Comment: How to solve:

You need to climb from 2000ft to FL80.

1. Convert FL to ft -> 8000 + (1040 - 1013) * 30 = 8810
2. Subtract TOC from altitude overhead VOR -> 8810-2000 = 6810
3. Calculate the time to TOC -> 6810 / 800 = 8.51
4. Multiply the time it took to climb over the GS -> 8.51 minutes * 133 = 18.9 NM
5. Find, on the chart, the distance between the VOR and VILNA -> 20
6. Subtract distance travelled from distance to VILNA -> 20 - 18.9 = 1 NM

Therefore, you reach the TOC 1 nm before VILNA.
- Name: JKirbs
  Comment: @Andrej I'm sorry but they are correct! FL80 is a pressure altitude and 2000ft is a true altitude. To find the aeroplane's time in climb we need these altitudes to be in the same format. When converting a pressure altitude into a true altitude, if the pressure is HIGHER than 1013 you ADD the difference (FL80 indicated now equals 8810ft true). In the explanation they started with the true altitude of 2000ft; as they ALREADY had the true altitude they did the OPPOSITE and SUBTRACTED the difference (2000ft true now equals 1190ft indicated)! So your altimeter must read 1190ft to be at a true altitude of 2000ft. To visualise this, imagine your altimeter reads 2000ft and you wind it from 1040 to 1013, wind off pressure, wind off altitude! SO the altimeter will drop! FYI I used 30ft per hPa in my calculations.

  Comment: Similar question, AustroControl , Portugal today
departure via CATON3A, cleared to FL80, but remain at 2000ft until passing ALT VOR/DME.
QNH 1040, ROC 800fpm GS133kts
a) 1NM before VILNA
b) 4NM before VILN
c) 1NM after VILNA
d) 4NM after vilna
correct - > a)
fl80 -> 8810ft -> climb 6810ft at 800fpm -> 8.5min -> 19nm (20-19=1nm before vilna)

  Comment: Similar in Greece today. You are at 2000ft at the vor, and want to climb to FL80. They gave ROC, GS and QNH (I don't remember them exactly) and asked at which point you would reach FL80. All answers were a few nm BEFORE VILNA (1nm, 4nm, and 2 more answers that I dont remember) the correct answer was 1nm before VILNA though

  Comment: Seen IAA Ireland but with different numbers but same procedure
- Name: Dale
  Comment: FL200 - FL80 = 12,000 ft
12,000ft / 1200fpm = 10 mins to make the climb
250kts x 10 mins = 41.7nm
The distances from VILNA to ASTRO are 14.7+12.3+8.8 = 35.8nm
41.7 - 35.8 = 5.9nm
So closest answer is 6nm after ASTRO

  Comment: What does PET stand for?
- Name: Philipp
  Comment: That one is pretty easy even without formulas. With 1000 NM divided by 180 GS and 2, you calculated that you're half way along the route after 2h 46 minutes, or 14:46 UTC. Since you are slower in that direction, the PET must be quite a bit later than 14:46, leaving only one possible answer. If you're struggling to remember the correct formula, you can always try easy workarounds like this.

- Name: Rinad
  Comment: I got this question (exact same - 2 points) - Austro control 3/6/2022
- Name: DENIZ
  Comment: nope It's corect.
we have 20kt head wind so our GS out =180 and GS Home=220,
from the formula X=(D.H)/(H+O) = (1000.220)/(400) =550; for finding time we need to divide into GS Out
which is 550/180= 3,05 hr or 183.3 min.
then our answer will be 15.03

- Name: TheColoradoToad
  Comment: Time from OKEPI to OKIRA = 1 min
Fuel used from OKEPI to OKIRA = 5990 - 5950 = 40 kg
Fuel Flow = 40 kg/min = 2400kg/hr
Time from MOU to MOKIP = 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 mins
10/60 x 2400 kg/hr = 400 kg of fuel burnt
5950 - 400 = 5550 kg

  Comment: Gosh the attachment is so hart to know what time is for what leg
- Name: Valentin
  Comment: In the legend, shouldn't AREM be "actual fuel remaining" rather than "actual fuel required"?
- Name: highflyer
  Comment: You can not calculate it by distance. When you calculate it by distance you will get 5535 which is wrong. When you think about it, it absollutly makes sense to use the leg time instead of the distance. Distance varies with groundspeed and says nothing about the fuel consumption in a given time.. The Groundspeed can be different in any of the given legs. So you have to calculate the fuel consumption in connection with the time.
- Name: Antony
  Comment: The precise answer is 5535 so closest this question is wrong !!
- Name: Dannyboy
  Comment: top of annex says actual fuel required= AREM not actual fuel remaining?
- Name: Gerbert
  Comment: seen in finland 13.1.2023. same ofp but a the actual fuel consumption had to be calculated from consumption between OKIRA and ELB, and it asked about fuel remaining at RIFFI
- Name: Werner
  Comment: @Maria: The time shown is to reach the waypoint, so It's 4 min to OKEPI, then 1 min to OKIRA and so forth.
@SAL: The one column is showing the PLANNED 'min fuel required', and the other is showing ACTUAL 'fuel remaining'. The legend says AREM = actual fuel required, but it should more accurately say AREM = actual fuel remaining. On most flights you will hope to reach each checkpoint with more fuel remaining than minimum, so that's why it's more.

  Comment: sometimes mountainous areas are above 5000ft, sometimes above 6000ft. The next question will probably tell me that the sea is also a mountainous area
- Name: Mat4546
  Comment: This question relates to SERA requirements which has to do with EASA. But up to 6000ft is what the part SERA requires.
5001ft is what jeppesen use, which is lower altitude cutoff.

please include it in explanation
- Name: DannyTheRaccoon
  Comment: I guess they mean that terrain VARIATION = mountain top - airport elevation (=3600ft here). Therefore, clearance must be 1500ft. . . -_-

( TERRAIN VARIATION -> MOC ) :
1000ft
3000-5000ft -> 1500ft
> 5000ft -> 2000ft
- Name: Karlvajs
  Comment: Sometimes it is less than 5000ft other times is less than 6000ft, MAKE UP YOUR MINDS
- Name: McEvoy
  Comment: Typo in the explanation too. Change ' 251 ' to ' 5600 ' - ' Thus, the height of the aircraft above the obstacle will be: True Altitude - obstacle elevation = 7449 ft - 251 ft = 1849 ft, thus obstacle clearance can be ensured. '
- Name: McEvoy
  Comment: Over 5000ft the MOCA is 600m. Based off this we DO NOT have the required terrain clearance. We would want at least 2000ft separation we only have 1849ft. Please clarify
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @McEvoy. Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA) is the lowest published altitude in effect between radio fixes on VOR airways, off-airways routes, or route segments, which meet obstacle clearance requirements for the entire route segment. Normally, this gives 1000 ft clearance over obstacles up to and including 6000 ft and 2000 ft clearance for obstacles over 6000 ft in elevation. It is indicated on an en-route charts with a "T" suffix.
Hey @joaomsilval, thanks for the feedback! If anyone else comes across this question please let us know whether the obstacle was 5800 ft or 5600 ft high. Thanks!
- Name: joaomsilval
  Comment: Got this question today but with different data give. Obstacle was 5800, we were flying over hilly terrain at FL80. asked for the terrain clearance. this option was stated, I chose. the other 3 were 2 no's with some clearance, and 2 yes, this one and with another clearance. it was given QNH 1003 and OAT-11 of an aerodrome elevation 2000

  Comment: THIS IS CALLED ADDITIONAL FUEL NOT ALTERNATE FUEL. . . .When you travel to an isolated aerodrome you do NOT have any alternate options . . . . Therefore you should have to use your trip fuel and contingency fuel.

In fact this is the literal procedure for Predetermined Point (pdp- 45mins+15%) where final reserve in included within the additional pdp.

could somebody explain please?

For Turbine :
2 h at normal cruise power (No final reserve !!)
- Name: Alexc202444
  Comment: Pretty sure it isn't Alternate fuel it's additional.
- Name: Thordur
  Comment: The wording is actually mis-leading, it is not alternate fuel, but for the PDP (pre-determined point) - isolated aerodrome routing, the additional fuel, which always includes the FRF.

Contingency is burnt-off and does not need to be consisdered, as it asked for the MINIMUM fuel overhead the isolated DEST.
- Name: CaptainChris
  Comment: shouldn't is read "additional fuel" instead of "alternate fuel"?
- Name: Shane
  Comment: (45/60 x 540 kg) + (15% x 2 hr x 540 kg) = 405 kg + 162 kg = 567 kg, to the nearest 10 kg: 570 kg.

  Comment: WATCHOUT, For isolated aerodromes, the final reserve is already included in additional fuel
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: for props, cruise time is capped at 2h. so ifi have 2h and 45min of cruise, my reference will still be 2h.
if my cruise is 1h and 45mins i will use 1h and 45mins. hope it makes sense.
so here it will be 45mins +15% of 2h (cause cruise is higher than 2h so it still caps at 2h)
- Name: MaxPiwb
  Comment: Agree with the result, but why are we talking about alternate in the explication?
From CAE course : "An Isolated aerodrome is defined as an aerodrome for which there is no Destination Alternate"
From this point we calculate the additional fuel accordingly to the regulation and we are done.
So confusing i'm thinking about piloting trains

- Name: Jean
  Comment: @Tom, no need for Contingency as the question says you are "overhead the isolated aerodrome". It is not required to still have it on board as you could have used it during the trip phase. Therefore only additional is required when arriving above the isolated destination (no less than reserve). Hope it helps
- Name: Harry
  Comment: PDP (Isolated Aerodrome) includes the final reserve fuel. So the 45 mins + 15% cruise time fuel includes your 45 mins reserve fuel, that's why you don't have to add it on, it's already accounted for.

** Remember this is part of the PDP procedure , so if an alternate was given then we would have to compare the Total fuel required to DEST , to the total fuel required to ALT via PDP and choose the additional from the highest TOTAL fuel required.
**FinRes is included in additional in PDP procedure.

  Comment: Fellow pilots, when we say we dont use final reserve, it means that we are not planning on flying on it as in normal conditions and this fuel shouldnt be normally accounted for. BUT. It doesnt mean that the fuel is something that could never be used. Your engines can still fly on it! Just that is gonna be a state of emergency already and all that MAYDAY minimum fuel declarations etc.. but it is still fuel! And it is very much useable. So basically, whatever is in the tank.

  Comment: @Darren , in this case I think they are talking about usable fuel in the tanks, as the tanks usually hold some unusable fuel which is located in the bottom of the tank. The final reserve fuel needs to be usuable otherwise you can't use it in a emergency.

Question Number: AT00338
- Name: DRU1024
  Comment: Don't get the explanation? The RNAV STAR overlay does exactly the same thing like the conventional RNAV STAR... it is for spacing and reduced workload of the controllers. One is flown with conventional navigation equipment, the other with GNSS. There is no difference?!
- Name: s7azin
  Comment: R-NAV STAR overlay is conventional mixed with GNSS
R-NAV STAR is GNSS only
RNAV STAR makes the ATC work easier because it doesn't use conventional systems like VOR where the ATC will have to monitor.
- Name: HadiK
  Comment: There is no difference, one is for conventional navigation equipment, and the overlay is the exact same but for R-NAV, what am I missing?
- Name: MandM
  Comment: No way to say ,,The RNAV STAR is designed to replace the conventional navigation systems routing,,
Isnt correct
- Name: kubarybaczyk
  Comment: So the basic difference is that RNAV STAR is a whole new route (ATC has to accomodate for the traffic on this SID and other conventional SIDs), RNAV overlay STAR is "laid over" the conventional SID route, so the ATC directs traffic only one route, this way it is better for coordination and work-load reduction, the only thing a pilot chooses is equipment with which they wish to navigate the route, but it doesn't change its shape and location of the turns. Hope that clear thing up a bit ;)

  Comment: I got a question like this in the IAA on the 17/6/24 Im not sure if its 100% if this is the question but it was very similar
- Name: SufferingATPL
  Comment: How is this different from Q333514? The correct answer for that question is very similar to B which is incorrect here.
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @SufferingATPL. The correct option in the question you mentioned is "RNAV STAR overlay", not "RNAV STAR". In option B in this question, the "RNAV STAR" is mentioned.
Additionally, the "RNAV STAR overlay" is also not designed to replace the conventional navigation systems routing. In short, it is designed to accurately define the conventional STAR route for area navigation equipment. Thank you for your comment.

- Name: Lawrence
  Comment: 332090 = Answer: The RNAV overlay SID will follow the same track as the conventional procedure. (It does not REPLACE it)


339005 = Answer: The RNAV STAR allows for efficient sequencing of the traffic flow, thus reducing the workload of the ATC.

Both exact same question, slightly different format of answers, don't get mixed up like i did! :)

- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @MarcoC. Under ISA, the tropopause is located at 36 000 ft, and above that, the temperature is held constant at –56.5°C. This question refers to FL350. Hope this clarifies!

  Comment: Now we are calculating tropopause temperature instead of using 56.5°c huh? SMH
- Name: ElPatron
  Comment: 38.95*sqrt(273-40)*0.74=439.9kts you're good
- Name: zeymahse
  Comment: Guys, this is actually simpler than it looks.
Our TAS at ISA should be 426kt
We are told that our OAT is -40°C and we have to confirm if it is indeed as the standart temperature should be at that altitude.
15° - (35'000 : 1'000 x 2) = -55°C ISA so we have deltaISA +15°C

Read notes. Note2 says that for each +1°C we have to increase our TAS by 1kt, so we have to increase our TAS by 15kt because we have +15°C od deltaISA.
426kt + 15kt = 441kt

  Comment: Instead of using formulas like a normal person that take 2 seconds, EASA will make us use an ABACUS next. Time wasting rubbish. Just use Mach 0.74 x (39squareroot(273+ -40) )

TAS = MACH x LOCAL SPEED OF SOUND
Local Speed of Sound = 39 square root ( 273 + OAT )
- Name: JRAVIATOR
  Comment: easier and simple way is look for tas up in the chart since its hotter will need more thrust therefore 1 answer left
- Name: pierinocolombo
  Comment: (38.95 x (sqrt 273-40) ) x 0.74 = 439.94kt
- Name: JoaoD
  Comment: Just look at the top of the table and at the bottom

On top It says we have a TAS of 426 kt
On the bottom we have the correction necessary to apply to our TAS

We are +15 C above isa , so 426+15 = 441
- Name: marmok
  Comment: TAS = M x LSS = M x 38.95 sqrt(K) = .74 x 38.95 sqrt(-40 + 273.15)
It gives 440.11, close enough.
- Name: Alexander
  Comment: Use CRP 5 and go on
- Name: Derick
  Comment: @Mohammed -- ISA dev = Actual Temp - ISA temp. (where actual is the OAT given and ISA is what you work out)

so ISA temp = 15-(2xFL)

Therefore, 15-(2x35) = -55

Then, ISA dev = (-40)-(-55) = +15

Then in the note is says increase by 1kt for each degree above ISA. So 15 x 1 = 15

So 426+15 = 441kt

but crp5 is better for CAS - TAS conversion honestly
- Name: Edoardo004
  Comment: TAS formula from CAS?
- Name: Fmaiate
  Comment: @EmmanuelHEGE just be careful with the TAS, the flight computer must be use in this case just to calculate the TAS, if the temperature is way different the CAS will change and consequently the TAS, therefore the use of the flight computer is just to make sure the CAS/TAS are correct, the rest of the question can be made by formulas. You can also calculate the CAS and TAS by formula but both go beyond the training.
- Name: mrKrauklis
  Comment: Nah this is crazy, how can they have 1 minute difference between q when you are using the CRP 5 and a micrometer of a difference = 1 minute..
- Name: EmmanuelHEGE
  Comment: why use flight computer ? We have calculated TAS (223 kts) and we have Wind 190/05 => angle between tailwind and track = 190 - (335 - 180) = 35 cos(35°) x 5 kts = 4 kts => GS = 223 + 4 = 227 kts So, for 61 Nm, it gives 16 minutes => ATA at C = 1228 Am I right ?

  Comment: @u4gmireGiGiDy
to tell the difference, the lines depict the necessary limits in altitude:
so if a blue line sits below the number (altitude/FL) it means you must be at or above that specific altitude/FL
if a blue line sits above the number (altitude/FL) it means you must be at or below that specific altitude/FL
so as seen by the 9.5DME arc, VILNA (CANTON2C) and NARGO, they all have blue lines below the FL/ALT therefore its at or above.
for CATON, you must be at or below FL230 due to the blue line being situated above the numbered FL230

- Name: sebwis
  Comment: you can answer these without even measuring or calculating because we know what the trap is -> by looking at the coordinates we can already see it must be west (something like 270 degrees), now that we know that in southern Germany/Austria the Variation is always around 2-4 degrees east(E) we need to subtract it from our True(T) value ->. thus its usually always the lower of those 2 (as we subtract our variation from our true track, and the trap answer is given in degrees True.

  Comment: If you dont want to measure, in this question you can just look at the answers and at variation. Just two answers could be correct and usually one of them is TRUE and one is MAGNETIC. Then just look at variation, which is east, so magnetic must be the smaller one.

As we mentioned in the explanation section, although the marked option is the most correct option among the options it is not entirely correct. If the question text had stated that the aircraft was being vectored or sent directly to an off-route waypoint, the marked answer would have been exactly correct.

  Comment: GM3 SERA.8005(b) Operation of air traffic control service

(c) The objectives of the air traffic control service as prescribed in ATS.TR.100 of Regulation (EU) 2017/373 do not include prevention of collision with terrain. Pilots are responsible for ensuring that any clearances issued by air traffic control units are safe in this respect. When vectoring or assigning a direct routing not included in the flight plan, which takes an IFR flight off published ATS route or instrument procedure, the procedures in ATS.TR.235(a)(5) of Regulation (EU) 2017/373 apply.

I guess in this case we have to be assigned some guidance to enter the IFR route structure from the VFR reporting point, therefore ATC has to provide us with obstacle clerance.

- Name: Benjamin
  Comment: Keep it easy, you can solve it by just using the pizza cutter (PJ-1 plotter), I get a distance just a little over 36NM by being super precise. Also a little tip with all of these types of questions is to add 1/2 to 1 NM to the distance as a margin, then you tend to get the right answer.
- Name: tilab
  Comment: Very easy. Use the latitude line, between two red crosses you have 30NM (like on all 500 000 VFR charts).
Between two red crosses you have 1260 with Measuring tool. Now you have to measure the distance between EDPS and the 4055ft obstacle. You will find 1571.
(1571x30NM)/1260 = 37.4 NM.
That's it.

- Name: Antoniorosado94
  Comment: In the real exam you just have to locate the locations using the coordinates and then measure with the plotter in NM in sectional 1:500,000

Here you have to use the rule, measure de units of distance beetwen the the two points and measure de units of distance along a meridian. That way you know that 1 degree of meridian is 1 nm and then you can do a rule of three and say; if 1256 units correspond to 30 nm, then 1565 units correspond to x. And you did it.

As a colleague here has said; If you are using an iPad to measure you have to select the ruler.
Than first tap on your first point.
Than DOUBLE tap on your second point!

This will give you the measurement.

1. Draw a line.
2. Measured the distance between the obstacle and the point along that line. In whatever units it is (depending on you zoom).
Lets say that segment is x units.
3. Place the same units along the closest longitude meridian. Counted that my x segment equals to 37min. That equals 37nm.
Done.
- Name: LAWRENCE
  Comment: The Correct way to approach this type of question is :
The Jepp Manual is allowed in the Flight Planning exam. The ED4 is contained in this manual.
The ED4 is a Lambert Conformal Chart at 500,000 scale so lines drawn on the chart at this scale are as near as possible accurate for true heading and very close on distance.
Buy a correctly scaled chart plotting ruler, these are allowed in the exam.
Use the Lat and Long to locate the points and draw a line with your pencil and then measure the line with your ruler, ensuring it's on the 500,000 scale side.
Voila 37NM.
This question should take under 1min to answer.

  Comment: @Nadav - I know it's a bit late for you now but in case it helps others and In response to your question
"How do you calculate the 1560? Or the 1254? Please help 🙏🏼 @atplq"

When you click on the annex you'll bring up a new tab on your browser. To the right are various tools, one of which has the letters ab written above them. This is used to measure the distance between two points.

If you measure between the features in the question you'll find your 1560.
Then if you measure along the meridian between grids, you'll get the 1254.
This 1254 is equal to 30 minutes of of latitude, which equals 30nm.

Now, 1560:1254 = 1.244.
1.244 * 30 = 37nm.

  Comment: Being LOW is BAD. Understand this and the corrections are easy one way or the other.

If its lower temperature or lower qnh (when changing from 1013) it means you are lower in height. So if you are going from FL to Height you know you have to substract. But if you are going from a minimum height required to a FL, then you know you have to add to compensate and protect yourself against the LOWER terrain clearance.

Being HIGH is good, so in that case is the opposite.

I hope this helps.
- Name: hercmate
  Comment: In order to decide whether to add or subtract a pressure correction, try the following:

1. Understand that when you twist the dial to set the required pressure setting, the altitude needle will move in the same direction.
2. Picture yourself twisting that dial and watching what the needle does.

EG flying at FL80, the pressure setting is 1013mb.
You twist the dial anti-clockwise to set 990mb and the needle follows, reducing indicated altitude.
So, you know you must subtract.

I hope this clarifies things! Appreciate your input.

  Comment: Dear all,
Thank you for your valuable comments and feedback. We would like to inform you that our team has been working diligently to address the inconsistencies in solving altimetry exercises. We understand the importance of a standardized approach, and we are committed to rectifying the issue.
One area of concern has been the lack of consistency in the method used for temperature corrections when determining the minimum usable flight level above an obstacle. The learning objectives clearly state that the elevation of the aerodrome must be taken into account, and the temperature correction should be applied to the column of air between the aerodrome and the aircraft's altitude. In cases where airfield elevation information is not provided, we will assume the aerodrome is at mean sea level (MSL). In this case, the airfield elevation is said to be 1 000 ft, and it must be taken into account for the temperature correction.
We are in the process of updating all explanations for questions of this nature, and the revised content will be available within the next few days. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to improve the clarity and consistency of our materials.
Explanation for this question updated.
Thank you once again for your contributions and support.

  Comment: Hi @Lince01. In this question, the phrase "B-RNAV equipment MANDATORY" is specified clearly. As we stated in the explanation for question 338605, if GERVU 1M was exclusively RNAV, it would be explicitly labeled as "RNAV," and there would be no radials or distances specified for the RNAV waypoints. In addition, if GERVU 1M was exclusively RNAV, it would also be stated that RNAV equipment is mandatory.

I know VOR DME is part of the Basic BRNAV but they still want you to refuse this route because all your equipment is inop
If question was stating a partial RNAV equipment failure then I would revert to basic BRNAV VOR DME navigation and I could accept this route
Thats how I see it

If the question stated ' what is the shortest route taking into account the CDR 3 routing RAMEN to MINKA being unavailable ' that would be a hell of a lot more fair

  Comment: Number 3 which means CDR 3 is on route B between BOLOT and MINKA, under sign 28, and red FL90.
I write it for everybody like my who are blind..

Also my advise , look on the marks, when there is triangle there is no Rnav anymore (correct me if im wrong).

Good luck

  Comment: ACG VIENNA TODAY - But the routes were different. Two of them were: M732 to ALG, L978 OBOBO AJO and the other was M732 to ALG, L42. The other routes had M858. In addition, they asked for the shortest suitable RNAV Route.

  Comment: @SyedAta on the route between BOLOT and MINKA, there is a "3" in a box which indicates it is a non-plannable route. It is an isolated version of the one which always sticks with a route designator (the black label on the routes). What it implies is the same.
I believe it is a shortened way to label it as there is insufficient space between fix or waypoints.

hope this help :)
- Name: SyedAta
  Comment: how would we come to know that M858 is a CDR 3 route from Ramen to MINKA and only assigned by ATC ?
- Name: Sabrur
  Comment: Here's an alternative way of thinking for those who are familiar with the meaning of pre-fix letters of a route:

A. J19 ( J = not an RNAV route) x
B. M858 ( 2 in a box = conditional route = Not an RNAV route) x
C. L (L = RNAV route) (correct)
D. M731 = (arrow pointing opposite direction, so we cannot even fly this) x

This way you don't even need to find the distance of ALL the 4 different options. Maybe you can bring it down to 2 options with other questions. And then you can measure distance and compare and save yourself some time

  Comment: Hi everyone, we wanted to share some valuable feedback we received via email from a helpful student regarding this question:
"I contacted CAA in Prague again but my comments were again rejected with even more absurd argumentation. So I decided to contact EASA directly to explain the whole situation to them, while I thoroughly studied all the regulations, including the syllabus for the subject 033, and after their evaluation, EASA contacted the office in Prague directly and finally my request was accepted. So I can confirm that the given answer "CAR-M732-ALG-L42-AJO" is correct."
Thank you all and we hope you find this information helpful!

- Name: andrea
  Comment: I have just one small doubt about this one. From what I understand if an airway has a number it is a conditional route so cannot be used except if approved by ATC. And one other thing. The route with J in front is not an Rnav Route so it should not be used if you need to follow an Rnav Route. In this case it was longer than the other one so no problem but is my statement correct or not?

which means from push back to engine shut down at destination.
therefore flight time does not equal trip time.

W/v is 190/065
and HDG is 330
330-190 = 140
65Xcos(140) = -49.79 => -50 (TAILWIND ) 224+ 50 = 274 kts
61NM/274kts = 13 MIN

cos(335-190)x65= -53. its TW so ignore the minus sign add 53 to 220 which gives u 273kt as GS.

- Name: stepiage
  Comment: @ bernat.. you can use the 2% rule of thumb for TAS ( TAS INCREASE BY 2% FOR EVERY 1000 FT)
In this case your TAS will be 160 plus its 42% ( 21 x2) (21 equals 21000 divided 1000) which is 227 kts (TAS)
You can get your tailwind value by doing 335 ( your track) minus the angle of origin of the wind ( 190) resulting 145..
do the cosine of 145, multiply that by wind intensity ( 65 kts) and get your tailwind.. which is 53 kts..
Groundspeed is then 227 plus 53.. equals 280 GS
61 Nm divided 280 Gs gives you 13 minutes.

There is a perfect functionality under Exam Question tab, where you can tick/see it, and you can also just select a test with only questions from your CAA.

But I like those initial seen comments, since they were encouraging others to report it as well.

  Comment: But is a deviation will also change TAS why dont u never consider that
- Name: TB20Sam
  Comment: ISA deviation does affect fuel flow, but it's negligible compared to the effect of a headwind. You can see that from the simplified planning graph 4.3.2c. The graph doesn't even bother to take account of ISA deviation to calculate the fuel required (it only uses the ISA deviation for the journey time).

So you can get the correct answer without even looking at table 4.5.3.2.
- Name: TheMetGod69
  Comment: It is asking for Trip Fuel, a quick look at the graph and ISA Dev only affects Time. Therefore any increase in headwind will leave to more fuel required. Easy
- Name: Typhoon
  Comment: ok memorize and move on. next. this eats up a lot of time even with your faster method. this is useless in a real exam and also it it a completely useless question that doesnt make me a better pilot. completely out of LO imo. (pretty much like 70% of the questions in EASA)

  Comment: @CommandantSharma Not exactly, the lower the GS (=higher HW), the lower will be the ground distance in a given time, the higher trip time, the higher fuel consumption.
- Name: CommandantSharma
  Comment: For this question all you need to know is,
-> The less is your ground speed = the higher will be the ground trip distance.

To see the results, just take the TAS from the graph and make all the correction according to the answer and choose the smallest speed.

  Comment: Don't need to calculate anything, its just testing if you understand what causes the most impact. If you look at the bottom of the chart 4.5.3.2 it says 0.6% change per 10c above/below ISA. Thats hardly anything compared to a 50kt headwind, making you 50 nautical miles an hour slower
- Name: NoahDB
  Comment: Got the question but why don't we consider the increase in TAS as well in A?
- Name: Johan
  Comment: in your explanation you compare the case "HW 30kt ISA +5C with the case "HW 30kt ISA -10C". you say that the second case will use less fuel because the temperature is lower. But is this reasoning correct? I explain: the ISA - 10C will decrease the tas with 10kts going from 424kt to 414kts. The HW causes the GS to be 414 - 30 = 384kt. So the trip time increases with 424/384 = 1.10. For the case "HW 30kt ISA+5C" you calculated in the explanation a trip time increase of 1.07. So this means that the first case "HW 30kt ISA +5C" will use less fuel than the second case "HW 30kt ISA -10C. On opposite conclusion than your conclusion. What is your reaction to this please? Kind regards.

- Name: The struggle
  Comment: Please can we have a Graph on explanation showing how we work this out @atplq
- Name: Adriano
  Comment: For those who want to be sure about the answer by drawing all the 4 cases:
- Use the 4.3.2c graph
- Draw each of the 4 cases
- Focus just on the Trip Time
- The more the time spent flying, the more fuel will be consumed
- You'll find out that the 50 kts HW will be the highest time spent airborne so it will be the correct answer

By the way, I don't know if this method is correct but it works for this problem

  Comment: Change in OAT affects trip TIME
Change in HW/TW affects trip FUEL (+HW = +fuel)
- Name: zanna90
  Comment: Wind changes really make a difference, not temp, as seen in many problems of this subject. Go for the answer with lots of wind.
- Name: Michael
  Comment: Appeared in Austro Control @ Spain 08/01/20
- Name: MichalStefanski
  Comment: You don't need to draw anything! Save time guys!
Just look at the graph:
- when you change temperature (like ISA deviation) only time changes but fuel stays the same => No Influence
- when you change wind however fuel changes => the more you change wind the more fuel changes
That's why the correct answer is the one with the biggest wind change!

They want you to learn how to use the graph and actually understand it.

  Comment: why no +1000ft for transition altitude regulation?
- Name: MartanBrix
  Comment: Seen today, ULC. Everything the same except QNH. 991 was given, so the anwser was fl60. Be careful!
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hello @MartanBrix, thank you for your feedback. The question you mentioned is available in our database, question number 333054.
- Name: Razor
  Comment: @CarloRomaFlyPE

Formula is ISA Deviation = OAT - ISA temp
Deviation = 15
OAT = -7

ISA = -7 - ( 15 )
= -22
- Name: BarrySeal225
  Comment: Didnt they state in another question the transition altitude should be plus 1000 for FL? Do get out of that block?
- Name: Justus1
  Comment: Variation is just to fool you guys! We fly magnetic and FL are also Magnetic Tracks! No need for any correction there! Keep on grinding
- Name: NicoH
  Comment: poor question, does not state from where that temperature is taken
- Name: CosminVoiculescu
  Comment: As a general rule - when Station Elevation given - it is Temp at the Station

If NO Station Elevation - the Temp is at MSL, unless specified at a FL or Altitude - given as OAT

I our question, station is at 27ft. It really isn't going to be much of a difference.
- Name: Marco
  Comment: @FaisalFINISHEDATPL, no, it doesent state where but it seems more correct from 27ft AD elevation as ISA dev is -22* although i did it at 3000ft i got ISA dev -16* and still got same answer, is always the same they try to mess with this instead of clearly say something, unveliebable.
- Name: FaisalFINISHEDATPL
  Comment: The question doesn't state where the temperature is taken from, doesn't it?
- Name: ATPL QUESTIONS
  Comment: Hi @Maksym, thank you for your comment. In fact, such questions should always be solved by considering the diagram. The changes in the solution depend on what you are looking for. If you have the true altitude and you are looking for the pressure altitude, you apply the temperature correction first and then the pressure correction. If you have the pressure altitude and you are looking for the true altitude, you apply the pressure correction first and then the temperature correction. Hope it helps.
- Name: Maksym
  Comment: In this case we first make TEMP corr, then PRESS corr.
But the diagram states first make PRESS corr.
help! Im totally confused

  Comment: Where in the question is stated that the temperature given is the temperature at the airfield and not the OAT in 3300 ft?
- Name: Scotty
  Comment: @Ralf
The temperature at the aerodrome is -7 degrees C. Therefore it is ISA -22 as it should be +15 degrees.

Once you've calculated the ISA deviation, you then need to correct for temperature error.
- Name: Ralle400
  Comment: Your calculation is wrong I think. The temp is ISA -15. 3.300 ft would be about 8 degrees ISA.
