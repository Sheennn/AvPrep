Refer to figure.
In the figure, all fuel figures are in kg. For this flight, how does the fuel consumption from top of climb to TORDU compare to the planned fuel consumption? The actual fuel consumption is…

Images:
- images/AT00001_img_1.png

Explanation:
The aircraft according to the planned fuel calculations should burn from Top of Climb to TORDU: 360 - 241 = 119 kg in 19:45 - 18:52 = 53 min.
Thus, its planned fuel consumption is: 119 kg / (53/60) hr = 134.7 kg/hr.
But, actually the aircraft burns 375 kg - 360 kg = 15 kg less, so at TORDU the actual remaining fuel after the pilot's fuel check will be: 241 kg + 15 kg = 256 kg.
Thus, the aircraft will burn from Top of Climb to TORDU: 375 kg - 256 kg = 119 kg in 19:42 - 18:52 = 50 min.
So, its actual fuel consumption will be: 119 kg / (50/60) = 142.8 kg/hr.
Therefore, its actual fuel consumption will be: 142.8 kg/hr - 134.7 kg/hr = 8.1 kg/hr higher than planned.

Options:
A. A
The same as planned.
B. C
3 kg/h lower than planned.
C. D
5 kg/h higher than planned.
D. B
8 kg/h higher than planned. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00003
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

What statement below is correct regarding the difference between an RNAV STAR and an RNAV STAR overlay?

Explanation:
The conventional Standard Arrival Route procedures (STARs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV STARs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS.
RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these.
An RNAV STAR overlay is a traditional STAR that allows pilots to use GPS equipment to fly existing, conventional STAR procedures, without replacing it. It follows the same route as the conventional procedure, with waypoints defined by coordinates instead of bearings and distances from ground navigation aids. In most cases, each ground navigation aid or intersection point of the conventional STAR, corresponds to an RNAV waypoint. Additionally, some RNAV waypoints (Fly-by or Fly-over) may be added, non-existing in the conventional STAR, to facilitate the turns.
An RNAV STAR overlay may be either shorter or longer in distance than an RNAV STAR, depending on the design.

Options:
A. B
An RNAV STAR overlay CANNOT follow the same route as a STAR that is defined by ground based navigation aids.
B. C
An RNAV STAR overlay will have a longer route distance than an RNAV STAR as it has less constraints.
C. D
An RNAV STAR overlay will have a shorter route distance than an RNAV STAR as it has less constraints.
D. A
An RNAV STAR overlay will follow the same route as a STAR that is defined by ground based navigation aids. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00004
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

If the actual in-flight wind produces a greater headwind than the forecast wind input into the FMC, what should be expected?

Explanation:
The Flight Management Computer (FMC) contains two databases:
A navigation database, which is updated every 28 days, including waypoints, airways, SIDs, STARs, approach procedures, runway lengths and minimum altitudes.
A performance database, which is updated only when rquired and is able to calculate maximum and optimum cruise altitudes, the optimum speeds for climb, cruise and descent and the required thrust settings for different phases of flight.
The FMC has, also, the ability to calculate speeds to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time, a selection known as RTA (Required Time of Arrival). In case the wind component is not as expected and input into the FMC, then it adjusts the speed so as to maintain the desired ETAs.
Thus, in case the actual in-flight wind produces a greater headwind than the forecast wind input into the FMC, then speeds will be increased to maintain ETAs.

Options:
A. A
Earlier ETAs will be generated by the FMC.
B. B
A new cruise level will be generated by the FMC.
C. D
The optimum level will be lowered.
D. C
Speeds will be increased to maintain ETAs. ✓ (CORRECT)

Correct Answer: D.

Question Number: AT00005
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

The flight crew has 1 hour flight time remaining of a 4 hours flight towards the destination aerodrome. The FMS displays the message DEST EFOB BELOW MIN and the Commander looks at the FMS data to see that there is an estimated 0.3 tonnes less fuel than required when arriving at the destination. Under NORMAL circumstances for a commercial Air transport flight with one destination alternate nominated, what is the minimum fuel to be expected on board when arriving at the destination aerodrome?

Explanation:
Final Reserve Fuel is a quantity of fuel that should never be used, but is carried in order to provide a final safety net. You should always land with Final Reserve Fuel intact in the tanks.
Alternate fuel is the fuel required from the missed approach point to the nominated alternate, including the fuel required for climb, cruise, descent, approach and landing.
According to the OPS 1.375 "In-flight fuel management":
The flight must be conducted so that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is not less than:
(i) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel, or
(ii) the final reserve fuel, if no alternate aerodrome is required.

Options:
A. A
Contingency fuel plus alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel.
B. B
Final reserve fuel only.
C. D
Contingency fuel plus final reserve fuel.
D. C
Alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel. ✓ (CORRECT)

Correct Answer: D.

Question Number: AT00006
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An IFR flight has been given descent instructions below the Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) but above the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA). The temperature is ISA -10°C. Who is responsible for terrain separation?

Explanation:
Radar vectoring is when ATC gives instructions for heading and altitude in order for an aircraft to follow a specific path, for example so that it can achieve VFR or join a procedure. ATC also makes sure to direct the aircraft to avoid conflicting traffic. When under radar vectors, ATC is fully responsible for separation with terrain and other traffic.
The Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA), also known as the Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitude (MRVA), is the lowest altitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during vectoring. It may be below the MSA and when under radar vectors the PIC can safely accept the routing.
This question does not specifically mention that the pilot is under radar vectors and as such the PIC is fully responsible for any terrain separation. Since the pilot is not being radar vectored, they should also not descend below the MSA, unless they are following a published procedure like a STAR (which does not appear to be the case in this question).
If a descent clearance places the aircraft below the Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA), the PIC must ensure terrain clearance by applying temperature corrections to account for ISA deviations, however there is no reason to descend below the MSA unless being vectored or following a published procedure. MSA includes a buffer for terrain clearance, but it does not account for lower-than-standard temperatures unless corrected by the pilot.

Options:
A. A
The PIC and the PIC should accept the routing.
B. B
The Controller and the PIC should not accept the routing.
C. C
The Controller and the PIC should accept the routing.
D. D
The PIC and the routing should not be accepted. ✓ (CORRECT)

Refer to Stuttgart 12-2 chart from Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
If you carry out an RNP approach to runway 25 at Stuttgart airport, what will be the distance covered from the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) to the Rwy 25 threshold?

Images:
- images/AT00008_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Initial Approach Fix (IAF) is a fix that marks the beginning of the initial approach segment and the end of the arrival segment (STAR), if applicable, i.e. it is a common fix point for both a STAR and an Approach procedure.
The approach chart depicts the "RNP Rwy 25" approach procedure, which begins from the IAF "LBU" RNAV waypoint. Information for the ground distance of each flight leg of the approach procedure, can be extracted from both the Approach Planview and the Approach Profile View.
Thus, the total distance from the IAF to the runway's threshold is:
5.3 NM (IAF LBU - DSS518) + 4.0 NM (DS518 - DS511) + 4.0 NM (DS511 - IF DS512) + 4.0 NM (IF DS512 - UNSER) + 4.0 NM + 4.7 NM (UNSER - RW25 threshold) = 26 NM.
NOTE: The distance from the Final Approach Fix "UNSER" to the runway's threshold is depicted on the Approach Profile View.

Question Number: AT00010
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to figure or to VFR chart ED-4 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
You are planning a VFR flight from Schärding Süben (LOLS) (48°24'11"N, 013°26'53"E) to Pfarrkirchen (EDNP) (48°25'12"N, 012°51'53"E) aerodromes, which of the following statements are true?
1. The cruising altitude should be 5500 ft
2. Your route follows the river "Rott" Westwards
3. The cruising altitude should be 6500 ft
4. You will enter class F airspace during the final approach
5. Your route follows the A3 motorway Northwards
6. You will enter class E airspace during the final approach

Images:
- images/AT00010_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Firstly, find the exact position of the two aerodromes, using the coordinates given and examine each statement carefully.
The aircraft follows a Westerly magnetic track from Schärding Süben (LOLS) to Pfarrkirchen (EDNP) aerodromes. According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for a westerly magnetic track, Even FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft should be flown (2 500 ft, 4 500 ft, 6 500 ft, etc.). So, a cruise altitude of 6 500 ft can be followed, which apart from being according to the ICAO rule, it provides obstacle clearance too. It is a bit higher than you might usually use for this route, but it is perfectly acceptable nonetheless.
Line features (rivers, motorways, railways, etc.) are highly recommended for navigation in VFR flights. The Rott river, as a line feature, is very helpful, because it is aligned with the Westerly flight direction and runs very close to the route. The A3 motorway does not follow the route.
The aircraft during its descent towards Pfarrkirchen (EDNP) destination aerodrome, will be within a Class F airspace with vertical limits from 1 500 ft AGL - 2500 ft AGL, initially, and as approaching to the destination aerodrome will remain within a Class F airspace with vertical limits from GND - 2500 ft AGL.

Question Number: AT00011
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Given the following information, calculate the maximum attainable flight time and range.
Average fuel flow: 9.6 US gal/h
Available fuel: 50 US gal
TAS: 100 kt
Wind component: 15 kt tailwind
The flight time is (1) _____ and the range is (2) _____.

Explanation:
With an Average fuel flow of 9.6 US gal/h and Available fuel of 50 US gal, the maximum flight time is: 50 US gal / 9.6 US gal/h = 5.20 hr or 5 hr 12 minutes, which is very close to 5 hours 13 minutes.
Because of the 15 kts tailwind, the Groundspeed is: TAS + tailwind velocity = 100 kt + 15 kt = 115 kt.
Thus, the range covered will be: Groundspeed x Flight time = 115 kt x 5.20 hr = 598 NM, which is close to 599 NM.

Options:
A. A
(1) 5 hours 20 minutes; (2) 521 NM

Question Number: AT00012
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Which temperature correction must be applied during an instrument approach?

Explanation:
When doing an approach in cold conditions, a temperature error correction must be applied since your aircraft will be lower than the indicated altitude. This is very dangerous, as it reduces vertical separation between your aircraft and obstacles. In warm conditions (>ISA), this is not as much of an issue since your aircraft will be at a higher altitude than the one indicated and you will have greater vertical separation from obstacles, however it is still good to make the correction to get an accurate altitude.
A good mnemonic to remember is "high to low lookout below". This mnemonic works for both temperature and pressure. If your aircraft is going from a high temperature/pressure area to a low temperature/pressure area, your altimeter will show you an indication that is higher than your true altitude. This means that you will be lower than desired, your vertical separation will be reduced and hence you must "lookout below".
In cold conditions, you must add a temperature error correction to the DH, MDH or MDA.
The temperature correction must be applied at the aerodrome level. This is because approach altitudes, such as the MDA or DA, are directly related to the aerodrome's elevation. Conditions are taken at the aerodrome level in order to get accurate altimeter readings and ensure terrain and obstacle clearance during landing. Altitudes at TOD are higher and less critical for terrain clearance.

Options:
A. B
Warmer than the temperature at the Top of Descent.
B. C
Warmer than the temperature at aerodrome level.
C. D
Colder than the temperature at the Top of Descent.
D. A
Colder than the temperature at aerodrome level. ✓ (CORRECT)

A piston-engined aeroplane on an IFR Commercial Air Transport flight arrives at its destination with the minimum fuel on board. During the approach procedure, the aircraft is forced to divert from the missed approach point to the alternate. Given the following information:
Trip Fuel: 235 litres
Alternate Fuel: 38 litres
Fuel for go around and one approach: 22 litres
Fuel flow at cruise speed: 80 l/h
Fuel flow at holding speed: 60 l/h
The minimum fuel required at the destination is (1) _____ and the minimum fuel required at the alternate is (2) _____.

Explanation:
Final Reserve Fuel is a quantity of fuel that should never be used, but is carried in order to provide a final safety net. You should always land with Final Reserve Fuel intact in the tanks.
According to the OPS 1.375 "In-flight fuel management-Aeroplane":
The flight must be conducted so that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is not less than:
(i) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel, or
(ii) the final reserve fuel, if no alternate aerodrome is required.
Final reserve fuel for a piston-engined aeroplane is the minimum fuel required to fly for 45 minutes: 45/60 hr x Holding Fuel flow = 45/60 hr x 60 l/h = 45 l.
Thus, the minimum fuel required at the:
Destination is: Final Reserve Fuel + Alternate Fuel = 45 litres + 38 litres = 83 litres.
Alternate is: Final Reserve Fuel = 45 litres.
NOTE:
Regarding the Final Reserve Fuel, for an aircraft with reciprocating engine, the definition just says that "It is equal with an amount of fuel to fly for 45 minutes". The selection between the Cruise Fuel Flow and the Holding Fuel Flow is according to the correct answer provided by feedback.

An aircraft flies from airport A to airport B, covering a total distance of 460 NM. After 1 h 11 min, it has covered a distance of 183 NM, and its remaining fuel is equal to 780 lb plus reserves. Determine the remaining fuel at airport B, assuming conditions remain the same and given:
TAS: 185 kt
Headwind: 30 kt
Trip fuel: 1 098 lb
Fuel flow: 370 lb/h

Explanation:
Note: Question asks us to assume that conditions remain the same, meaning that we should calculate the actual fuel consumption and groound speed during the first 183 NM (disregarding the Fuel Flow/GS provided by the question).
1) Determine Fuel consumed and fuel consumption during the first 183 NM:
Fuel Consumed = 1 098 lb - 780 lb = 318 lb
Fuel Consumption = (318 lb / 71 min) x 60 min/h
Fuel Consumption = 269 lb/h
2) Calculate actual Ground Speed during the first 183 NM:
Ground Speed = (183 NM / 71 min) x 60 min/h = 155 kt
3) Calculate remaining distance and flight time:
Remaining distance = 460 NM - 183 NM = 277 NM
Remaining Flight time = 277 NM / 155 kt = 1.79 h
4) Calculate fuel consumed during the remaining distance:
Fuel Consumed = 1.79 h x 269 lb/h = 481.5 lb
5) Remaining fuel at airport B:
780 lb - 481.5 lb = 298.5 lb = 299 lb + reserves

Options:
A. A
235 lb + reserves
B. B
119 lb + reserves
C. C
385 lb + reserves
D. D
299 lb + reserves ✓ (CORRECT)

Who is responsible for terrain separation during an IFR flight on an ATS route?

Explanation:
At all times, whether flying inside or outside controlled airspace in IFR, the Pilot-In-Command (PIC) remains responsible for terrain and collision avoidance.
When "under vectors", it means that a radar control service is being provided, i.e. the PIC must do what he is told by the radar unit and the ATC assumes responsibility for separation and terrain clearance in flight, providing bearing, distance and height information.
Therefore, the Pilot-In-Command is responsible for terrain separation in flight at all times, unless under vectors by radar.

Options:
A. B
The Operator.
B. C
Air Traffic Control service.
C. D
The aircraft owner.

An aircraft is making a 2D (LNAV) approach under IMC, to an aerodrome where the temperature is significantly different from ISA. Which of the following is correct regarding temperature corrections to the MDA?

Explanation:
If the temperature is lower or colder than ISA, then the aircraft's true altitude will be lower than the indicated altitude and a correction needs to be made to all minimum altitudes/heights to maintain the required separation from terrain.
LNAV is a GNSS (RNAV) approach using internal aids (GPS) for a non-precision (2D) approach, where no vertical guidance is provided, only lateral. The pilot must calculate a rate of descent and normally use a Continuous Descent Final Approach (CDFA) method.
Therefore, the pilot is responsible for temperature error corrections and cannot rely on ATC.

Options:
A. A

Given: Planned and actual data as shown in the Flight Log excerpt.
Provided that flight conditions on the leg GAMMA to DELTA remain unchanged and fuel consumption remains unchanged, what fuel remaining should be expected at waypoint DELTA?

Images:
- images/AT00022_img_1.png

Explanation:
First Step: Calculate the actual fuel consumption BETA - GAMMA
Fuel consumed BETA - GAMMA = Actual Fuel remaining at BETA - Actual Fuel Remaining at GAMMA
5200 kg – 4850 kg = 350 kg
Time BETA – GAMMA = 2:18 – 1:53 = 25 min
Fuel Consumption = 350 / 25 = 14 kg/min
Second Step: Calculate fuel consumed GAMMA - DELTA
Note: provided that the flight conditions will not change, the ATA over DELTA will be equal to ETA => 3:03.
TIME GAMMA - DELTA = 3:03 - 2:18 = 45 min
Fuel consumed: 45 min x 14 kg/min = 630 kg
Third Step: Calculate Fuel remaining at DELTA
FUEL at DELTA = Actual Fuel over GAMMA - Fuel Consumed (GAMMA - DELTA)
FUEL at DELTA = 4850 kg – 630 kg = 4220 kg

Options:
A. B
4340 kg
B. C

Refer to figure.
The annex shows the fuel breakdown for a flight from VOGO (Goa) to EGCC (Manchester). The pilots decide to carry an extra 1500 kg of fuel due to weather at the destination. Using a fuel flow of 4.6 tonnes per hour, how much extra holding time in minutes will this extra fuel give at the destination of EGCC, if required?

Images:
- images/AT00023_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Fuel flow of 4600 kg per hour is given.
If you check the table extra 1000 kg of fuel has a penalty of 236 kg fuel. This means it costs 236 kg of fuel to carry an extra 1000 kg of fuel.
Therefore extra 1500 kg of fuel will cause 1.5 x 236 = 354 kg fuel penalty.
It will leave us 1500 - 354 = 1146 kg of usable fuel for holding.
1146/4600 = 0.25 hours, which, when multiplied by 60, equates to 15 min of fuel burn.

If the Pre determined Point PDP procedure has to be applied for a Commercial Air Transport flight, the remaining fuel at the PDP must be sufficient for continuation to

Explanation:
Predetermined point (PDP)
This procedure is used when there is not enough fuel tank capacity to fly first to the destination airport and then to the alternate airport and still have final reserve fuel on board. A predetermined point is selected along the route at which the crew decides whether continuing to the intended destination reasonably assures successful landing or whether the alternate destination is a safer choice.
Regulation (EU) No 965/2012
AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.150(b) Fuel policy
(c) Predetermined point (PDP) procedure
If the operator’s fuel policy includes planning to a destination alternate aerodrome where the distance between the destination aerodrome and the destination alternate aerodrome is such that a flight can only be routed via a predetermined point to one of these aerodromes, the amount of usable fuel, on board for departure, should be the greater of (c)(1) or (c)(2):
(1) The sum of:
(i) taxi fuel;
(ii) trip fuel from the departure aerodrome to the destination aerodrome, via the predetermined point;
(iii) contingency fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(3);

For an aircraft flying VFR from Straubing (EDMS) aerodrome (N48°54.0’ E012°31.1’) to Linz International (LOWL) aerodrome (N48°14.1’ E014°11.3’), what is the ideal cruise level between the following options?

Images:
- images/AT00026_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Firstly, find the exact position of the two aerodromes, using the coordinates given, draw a straight line as a route between them and examine each statement carefully. Before the route is recorded on the flight plan, we need to consider the altitude to fly at. The Minimum Grid Area Altitudes along the route are 5 400 ft, 7 200 ft and 4 100 ft. For this VFR flight, the minimum safe altitude along the whole route is 7 200 ft. But, we have to also consider the ICAO VFR cruising altitudes and select an appropriate altitude for this easterly magnetic track. According to the ICAO VFR semi-circular rule, for an easterly magnetic track, Odd FLs/Altitudes + 500 ft must be followed (3 500 ft, 5 500 ft, 7 500 ft, 9 500 ft etc.). So, a cruise altitude of 9 500 ft can be followed, which apart from being according to the ICAO rule, it provides enough obstacle clearance too. The entire route can be flown at a lower altitude, such as 7 500 ft, but 9 500 ft is the altitude that provides the minimum obstacle clearance appropriate to the destination between the available options.

Images:
- images/AT00028_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The question asks for the estimated (planned) sector and accumulated times, because all the given times until WPT C are based on estimated (planned) Groundspeeds.
Sector time from C to DEST: Sector distance from C to DEST / Est. GS = 15 NM/80 kt x 60 = 11 min.
Sector time from DEST to ALTN: Sector distance from DEST to ALTN / Est GS = 20 NM/60 kt x 60 = 20 min. Thus, the accumulated time at ALTN will be: Accumulated time at B + Sector time from B to C + Sector time from C to DEST + Sector time from DEST to ALTN = 29 min + 25 min + 11 min + 20 min = 85 min or 1hr and 25 min.

Question Number: AT00029
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Given the following information for a Commercial Air Transport operation, calculate the maximum possible Extra Fuel, including any fuel penalty, that can be uplifted.
MTOM: 233 000 kg
MLM: 182 000 kg
MZFM: 170 000 kg
DOM: 122 550 kg
Traffic Load: 43217 kg
Trip Fuel: 45854 kg
Planned T/O Fuel: 51616 kg
Taxi Fuel: 300 kg
Fuel penalty for carrying Extra Fuel: 394 kg per 1000 kg of Extra Fuel
Fuel tank capacity: 110 000 kg

Explanation:
In order to find out the amount of fuel which can be uplifted you have to calculate the MTOM, MLM and tank capacity limitation
Note: MZFM does not limit fuel.
BASED ON MTOM:
MTOM – (ATOM) = 233 000 kg - 217 383 kg = 15 617 kg
ATOM = DOM + Traffic Load + Take Off fuel = 122 550 kg + 43 217 kg + 51 616 kg = 217 383 kg
BASED ON MLM:
MLM – Landing mass = 182 000 kg - 171 529 kg = 10 471 kg
LM = ATOM - Trip fuel = 217 383 kg - 45 854 kg = 171 529 kg
On top of this calculation, for the MLM limitation we have to apply the fuel penalty - which will be burned off during the flight
Rule of thumb: to calculate fuel penalty, use the following formula:
(MLM extra / 1000) x Y
- where "Y" is the variable given by the question, in this case = 394
(10 471/1000) x 394 = 4126 kg
Extra fuel that can be loaded is the sum of MLM extra (10 471 lb) and fuel penalty:
10 471 kg + 4126 kg = 14 597 kg
=> The most restricting value in based on MLM 14 597 kg

Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Which option is correct as regards checking the availability of the GNSS service for flights that will rely on GNSS information for guidance?

Explanation:
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) refers to a constellation of satellites providing signals from space that transmit positioning and timing data to GNSS receivers. The receivers then use this data to determine location.
The GNSS system requires a "notional" constellation, a design minimum to make the system work.
Thus, it is important, before flight, to check that there will be enough satellites visible for an accurate position at all stages of the flight.
This GNSS achievability can be verified by checking NOTAMs and the notice advisory to NANU messages, which provide updates on the GPS constellation.

Options:
A. B
The availability of satellites is dependent on ground-based navigation aids.
B. C
The availability of satellites is dependent on the aircraft's equipment.
C. D
Satellites may NOT be available due to terrain and/or antenna masking.

When reviewing the wind charts in the briefing room, you notice that the average wind in cruise will be 25 kt tailwind. Given following data, what will be the flight time to destination?
Time to top of climb: 30 min
Cruise leg: 740 NM
FL380
TAS: 460 kt
ISA: -10°C
Time to from top of descent to landing: 22 minutes

Explanation:
Let's begin by finding the cruise groundspeed:
Cruise GS = TAS + tailwind = 460 kt + 25 kt = 485 kt
Now, with the groundspeed determined, we can compute the cruising flight time:
Time = (Distance ÷ GS)
Time = 740 NM ÷ 485 kt = 1.52577 hours = 91.55 minutes
Finally, we can calculate the flight time to the destination:
Flight time to destination = Time to top of climb + cruise + Time from top of descent to landing
Flight time to destination = 30 minutes + 91.55 minutes + 22 minutes = 143.8 minutes
Flight time to destination = 2 hours 24 minutes

Due to operational requirements, fuel must be tankered on departure from the aerodrome.
Given a departure/destination fuel price ratio of 0.93 and the provided data, determine the optimum amount of fuel that can be tankered:
Cruise flight level: FL350
Air distance to be covered: 2 000 NM
Planned Take-Off Mass: 180 000 kg (with a minimum prescribed fuel quantity of 30 000 kg that includes a Trip Fuel of 22 000 kg)
Maximum Landing Mass: 170 000 kg
Maximum Take-Off Mass: 210 000 kg
Maximum tank capacity: 40 000 kg

Images:
- images/AT00037_img_1.png
- images/AT00037_img_2.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
[1] Enter the graph with the fuel price ratio set at 0.93.
[2] Move horizontally to the Air distance of 2 000 NM.
[3] Then, drop vertically to locate the Optimum weight at 184 000 kg. The Planned Takeoff Mass (TOM) is specified as 180 000 kg. Therefore, this indicates that they may be able to tanker 4 000 kg of fuel.
Next, we need to assess the feasibility of tankering an additional 4 000 kg of fuel by considering tank capacity, Maximum Takeoff Mass (MTOM), and Maximum Landing Mass (MLM) limitations:
The tank capacity is 40 000 kg, and the planned fuel is 30 000 kg, indicating that tankering 4 000 kg is feasible.
Considering the MTOM of 210 000 kg, tankering is also permissible within this constraint.
Calculating the Planned Landing Mass (PLM) as 180 000 kg - 22 000 kg (trip fuel) = 158 000 kg. The MLM is 170 000 kg, indicating that tankering 4 000 kg is within limits.

Images:
- images/AT00038_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
The Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA) is printed on the instrument approach charts. It identifies the minimum altitude that provides a 1 000 ft vertical clearance above obstacles within 25 NM of the navigational facility. It may be given as one value or could be divided into sectors, each sector having a different value.
The MSA is for emergency use only and on the approach charts, it is depicted at the top right corner.
For this approach chart, the MSA is with reference to the ALT VOR/DME. Between the inbound magnetic bearings 060º and 175º, or between Radial 240º and Radial 355º correspondingly, the MSA is 5 900 ft within 25 NM.
Since the aircraft is approaching from Radial 243° (between R240º and R355º) , then the MSA is 5 900 ft.

You are flying VFR to an aerodrome which only has GNSS procedures available. You check the availability of the satellites before departure. From what time must you ensure that you have full satellite availability so that you can proceed with your flight?

Explanation:
Since you are flying VFR, it is not necessary to have GNSS availability during take-off or cruise as you are going to be navigating visually. The main concern in this scenario is making sure that you will have GNSS availability when you actually need it which is during the approach phase. Since the approach phase starts at the IAF, this is the time from which we must ensure we have full satellite availability.
Flying a GNSS approach as a VFR flight, still requires you to have visual reference to the ground and the runway. It still demands that you meet the requirements in terms of visibility and separation from clouds.

Options:
A. A
Before the planned ToD (14:40)
B. C
1 hour before your flight (12:00)
C. D
Before taking-off (13:00)
D. B

Question Number: AT00041
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft is flying at FL035 above an airfield with an elevation of 1416 ft. If the airfield QNH is 1025 hPa, and the temperature is 12°C below ISA, what is the true height above the aerodrome datum?
(Assume 30 ft per hPa.)

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1025 hPa - 1013 hPa = 12 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­360 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude = 3500 ft + 360 ft = 3860 ft.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12°C. For temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 3860 ft - 1416 ft = 2444 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (2444/1000) = 117 ft.
The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 3860 ft - 117 ft = 3743 ft.
Thus, the true height of the aircraft above the airfield datum will be: True Altitude - Airfield datum elevation = 3743 ft - 1416 ft = 2327 ft, which is very close to 2330 ft.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.
Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.
True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.

Refer to figure.
The annex depicts a pilot's flight plan/log from LPFR to LEMG extracted by a flight planning software. When approaching VJF, the pilots realizes abnormal airframe vibrations and reduces speed from VJF. When overhead Tarifa, the pilot calculates that according to the new speed, the flight time from Tarifa to LEMG will be 47 minutes. Taking into account the latest fuel flow after VJF, the fuel consumption will be...

Images:
- images/AT00042_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The Planned Remaining fuel at LEMG is: Planned Block fuel - Planned Fuel Consumed = 430 kg - 309.6 kg = 120.4 kg.
Actual Fuel Flow from VJF to Tarifa: 40 kg in 17 min = 141 kg/hr.
Fuel consumption from Tarifa to LEMG: Revised Time from Tarifa to LEMG x Actual Fuel Flow from VJF to Tarifa = 47/60 hr x 141 kg/h = 111 kg.
Actual Remaining fuel at LEMG: Actual Fuel On-Board at Tarifa - Fuel consumption from Tarifa to LEMG = 207 kg - 111 kg = 96 kg.
Thus, the fuel flow may be less, due to the decreased speed, but the fuel consumption will be greater, since the fuel remaining at LEMG will be: Planned Remaining fuel at LEMG - Actual Remaining fuel at LEMG = 120.4 kg - 96 kg = 24 kg Less than planned.

Explanation Images:
- images/explanation_AT00042_img_1.png

Options:
A. A
lower since the lower speed gives a lower fuel flow which results in landing with 24 kg more fuel than planned in LEMG.
B. C
lower since the fuel flow has reduced to 141 kg/h giving 120 kg fuel remaining when landing in LEMG.
C. D
greater since the fuel flow has increased to 163 kg/h giving 120 kg fuel remaining when landing in LEMG.
D. B
greater since the effect of the reduced fuel flow is offset by the lower speed giving 24 kg less fuel than planned in LEMG. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00043
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

The minimum altitude for the route being flown is 7000 ft. Considering headwinds ranging from 9 to 16 knots, you need to determine the highest ground mileage per gallon of fuel. The true airspeeds (TAS) provided range between 169 and 175 knots, and the fuel flow is constant at 15.5 GPH at all altitudes. Which altitude provides the highest ground mileage per GPH?

Explanation:
Let's calculate all of the options to find the nautical miles covered per gallon of fuel at the different altitudes:
"6000 ft - TAS: 175 knots, Headwind: 9 knots"
175 kt - 9 kt = 166 kt
166 kt / 15.5 GPH = 10.7 NM per gallon
"7000 ft - TAS: 173 knots, Headwind: 10 knots"
173 kt - 10 kt = 163 kt
163 kt / 15.5 GPH = 10.5 NM per gallon
"8000 ft - TAS: 171 knots, Headwind: 12 knots"
171 kt - 12 kt = 159 kt
159 kt / 15.5 GPH = 10.3 NM per gallon
"9000 ft - TAS: 169 knots, Headwind: 16 knots"
169 kt - 16 kt = 153 kt
153 kt / 15.5 GPH = 9.9 NM per gallon
From this we can see that the altitude that provides the highest ground mileage per gallon is 6000 ft. This is the correct answer.
Note: The question states that the minimum altitude for the route is 7000 ft, so it is very strange that correct answer is below that altitude. Please report the correct answer to us, if you get this question in your exam.

Options:
A. A
7000 ft - TAS: 173 knots, Headwind: 10 knots
B. B
8000 ft - TAS: 171 knots, Headwind: 12 knots
C. C
9000 ft - TAS: 169 knots, Headwind: 16 knots
D. D
6000 ft - TAS: 175 knots, Headwind: 9 knots ✓ (CORRECT)

Explanation:
In the regulation below, it is stated that the taxi fuel is calculated for the departure aerodrome only, therefore don't get confused by the question which also mentions taxi time at destination. Additionally we have to consider APU fuel:
In the attached document we can see that the taxi fuel is 11 kg/min and that the APU consumes 115 kg/h:
10 minutes × 11 kg/min = 110 kg
115 kg / 25 min = 48 kg

Given the following information for a Commercial Air Transport operation, calculate the maximum possible Extra Fuel to be uplifted.
Maximum Zero Fuel Mass MZFM: 2000 kg
Actual Zero Fuel Mass AZFM: 2000 kg
Regulated Take-Off Mass RTOM: 3000 kg
Maximum Landing Mass MLM: 2200 kg
Fuel Tank Capacity: 550 kg
Trip Fuel TF: 190 kg
Minimum Block Fuel (BF): 300 kg

Explanation:
In order to find out the amount of fuel which can be uplifted you have to calculate the MTOM, MLM and tank capacity limitation
Note: MZFM does not limit fuel.
BASED ON RTOM:
RTOM – (ATOM) = 3000 kg - 2300 kg = 700 kg
ATOM = AZFM + Take Off fuel = 2000 kg + 300 kg = 2300 kg
Since we are not provided with taxi fuel => we will assume our take off fuel equals our block fuel.
BASED ON MLM:
MLM – Landing mass = 2200 kg - 2110 kg = 90kg
LM = ATOM - Trip fuel = 2300 kg - 190 kg = 2110 kg
BASED ON TANK CAPACITY:
550 kg - 300 kg = 250 kg
=> The most restricting value in based on MLM 90 kg.

Refer to figure.
You are cruising at FL380 with a twin-engined jet aeroplane. Due to airspace restrictions ATC instructs you to reduce speed to Mach .786. Given the following information, what is the fuel you will use for the remainder of the cruise time?
Distance to Top-of-Descent: 310 NM
Aircraft mass: 60 000 kg
TAT: -22°C
Average wind component: 25 kt headwind
Consider a constant aircraft of mass 60 000 kg for calculation purposes.

Images:
- images/AT00055_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Actual TAT at FL380 is -22o C, so it is above the standard TAT -32o C, given in the table, by 10o C.
According to the table given, at FL380 with .786 Mach speed, 60 000 kg mass and TAT -32o C, the TAS is 451 kt and the Fuel Flow per engine is 1 087 kg/hr.
To calculate the fuel flow required for the ground distance 310 NM, the actual time flown is required:
Actual time= Ground distance / Ground speed.
With a 25 kt headwind, the groundspeed will be 451 - 25 = 426 kt. Applying the note, the TAS must be increased by 1 kts for each degree above standard TAT. So, it becomes: 426 + 10 = 436 kt
The a/c will cover the ground distance 310 NM with 436 kt groundspeed in: 310/436 = 0.71 hour.
For 0.71 hr flight time, the a/c will burn: 1 087 x 0.71 = 772 kg per engine, so both engines will burn: 772 x 2 = 1 544 kg.
Applying the note, the fuel flow must be increased by 3% per 10o C above standard TAT. So, it becomes: 1 544 + (3% x 1 544) = 1 590 kg.

At 14:58 ATC instructs you to fly directly to OAL VOR/DME and reduce speed to M 0.76, for traffic separation purposes. Given the following information, what is the Revised ETA at OAL?
Distance to OAL via the flight-planned route: 120 NM
Direct distance to OAL: 90 NM
Magnetic Track to OAL from present position: 053°
Variation: 2°E
Pre-flight planned Mach: 0.80
Forecast Wind: 350°/40 kt
Actual Wind: 045°/65 kt
OAT: -35°C
ETA at OAL: 15:08

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
This question asks for the Revised or Actual time of arrival at OAL VOR/DME, so use the actual data given below the answer:
1. Following the rhyme "Variation East, Magnetic Least", the True Track from present position to OAL is: 053o(M) + 2oE = 055o(T).
2. Using your Flight/Navigation computer find the actual TAS:
Rotate the inner dial until you see the "Mach No. Index" inside the airspeed correction window on the inner dial.
Line up the OAT -35°C opposite to the "Mach No. Index".
Reduded Mach number 0.76(76) on the inner scale, reads opposite TAS 456 kt.
3. Using again your Flight/Navigation computer find the Groundspeed:
Set wind direction to 045º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 456 kt.
Mark the wind velocity 65 kt down from the centre point.
Initially, set the True Track to 055º under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
Note that this heading would result in 2ºR drift and a track of 057º.
Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 055º. This occurs at a heading of 053º with 1ºR drift.
The groundspeed for this track is approximately 395 kt.
4. The Revised flight time to OAL VOR/DME is given by the formula: Time = Direct Distance to OAL / Grounspeed = 90 NM / 395 KT = 0.23 hr or 13.8 min , rounded 14 min.
Therefore, the Revised ETA at OAL will be: 14:58 + 14 min = 15:12.

Given the following data, what is the TAS of the aeroplane?
FL390
OAT: ISA -10 C
Mach number : M 0.82
Wind component : -42 kt

Explanation:
- METHOD 1: FORMULA
ISA temperature at FL390 = -56.5ºC
ISA - 10ºC
Therefore, OAT at FL390 = -66.5ºC
M = TAS / LSS
LSS = 38.95 x √ OAT (KELVIN)
TAS = M x 38.95 √ OAT (KELVIN)
TAS = 0.82 x 38.95 √ (-66.5 + 273) = 459 kt (Closest Option: 460 kt)
- METHOD 2: FLIGHT COMPUTER
(1) Airspeed window - Rotate to see "MACH No Index". Set OAT (-66.5ºC).

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The ATA at LIBLO is at 13:19 and the ATA at BTA is 13:31. So, the aircraft needs 12 minutes to cover a distance of 35 NM.
So, its Actual GS will be: Distance from LIBLO to BTA / Sector time = 35 NM/12 min x 60 = 175 kt.

Question Number: AT00062
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An IFR flight is planned across terrain where the maximum elevation is 4385 ft. The forecast temperature is ISA +12° C, and the Minimum Obstacle Clearance required is 1500 ft. A nearby aerodrome elevation 875 ft reports a QNH of 1025 hPa.
What is the minimum flight level that could be planned for the cruise?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 5 885 ft (4 385 ft + 1 500 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +12ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 5 885 ft - 875 ft = 5 010 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (12) × (5 010/1 000) = 240 ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 5 645 ft.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1025 hPa - 1013 hPa = 12 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 12 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 360 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 5 645 ft - 360 ft = 5 285 ft.
The Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL60.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.
Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.
True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.

A flight has been diverted off the planned route due to the bad weather. ATC clears the flight to re-join the planned route at TUSKA. The pilot wishes to decide early, if there is enough fuel to safely complete the flight or if a fuel diversion is needed, so he/she checks the fuel at 18:06 UTC. Following the data, what is minimum fuel required at 18:06 UTC to complete the planned flight?
Minimum fuel at TUSKA to complete the flight: 144 litres
Average fuel flow: 45 kg/h
ETO TUSKA: 18:43 UTC
Fuel density: 0.72 kg/lt

Explanation:
You want to be at TUSKA 18:43 with 144 litres fuel on board. The time now is 18:06. You need 37 minutes of flight from now to TUSKA.
With Fuel flow = 45 kg/hour or 0.75 kg/min, you must have 0.75 x 37=27,75 kg of fuel or 28 kg.
With a fuel density of 0,72 kg/lt, the 28 kg = 38,5 litres.
So 144+39=183 litres.

Refer to Stuttgart SID chart 10-3P from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
An aircraft taking-off from Stuttgart has received clearance for the DKB4H RNAV SID. Traditional IFR equipment is required to continue the flight in case the GNSS integrity is lost. Which of the following equipment must be available in order to execute the RNAV SID?
1. Aircraft VOR and DME receivers
2. Aircraft GPS receivers
3. Aircraft ADF receiver
4. STG and LBU navigational aids
5. STG and DKB navigational aids

Images:
- images/AT00067_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Area Navigation (RNAV) is defined as a method of navigation which permitts aircraft operation on any desired flight path within the coverage of station - referenced navigation aids or within the limits of the capability of self-contained aids, or a combination of these. In simple words, the ability to fly from point to point, rather than following VOR radials or NDB bearings.
The conventional Standard Instrument Departure procedures (SIDs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV SIDs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS.
RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these.
GNSS/GPS receiver is an essential part of the RNAV system, as many of the waypoints will rely upon GPS coordinates.
The FMS takes navigational inputs from GPS, IRS and ground navigational aids. If GPS signal is lost, then IRS and ground navigational aids still work, as a back-up option.
Thus, the aircraft's GPS receiver must be always available for the RNAV SID procedure and the others are required in case of problem with the GNSS.
Obviously, the aircraft's VOR and DME receivers must be serviceable, since the DKB4H RNAV SID procedure uses the ground navigational aids STG and DKB VOR/DMEs for guidance, which must be serviceable too.

Question Number: AT00069
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

When planning to fly through a mountaineous area, the minimum safe altitude (MSA) is 8 000 ft. The QNH from an airport in the vicinity, elevation 0 ft, is 990 hPa and the temperature at FL100 is -25°C. Determine the lowest usable flight level.
(Assume 1 hPa = 27 ft)

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 8 000 ft (MSA). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (10 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-5ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-25ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -20ºC.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (8 000/1000) = -640 ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 640 ft.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate of 27 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 27 ft/hPa = 621 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 8 640 ft + 621 ft = 9 261 ft.
The Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL100.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Question Number: AT00070
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft is flying at FL180, OAT -11°C, QNH 1003. What is the true altitude?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
True altitude calculation from a Flight Level:
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­300 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude = 18 000 ft - 300 ft = 17 700 ft.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL250). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (18 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-21 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-11 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA +10ºC.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (17 700/1000) = + 708 ft.
The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 17 700 ft + 708 ft = 18 408 ft
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question).
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

What Type and Category of approach is a 2D APCH with a MDH of 350 ft?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
According to ICAO Annex 6, Annex 10 and Annex 14, there are two types of classification for approach operations, dependent upon the achieved minima at the end of the approach:
Type A: may be either 2D or 3D operations; 2D will only have a lateral path defined for the approach operation where 3D will have both a lateral and vertical path defined for that operation. A Type A operation will permit aircraft operations down to a minimum height or altitude of 250 ft. All NPAs and Approcahes with Vertical guidance (APV) using Barometric altimetry are Type A approach operations.
Type B: are 3D operations; a lateral and vertical path is defined and guidance along this path is provided either from GPS with SBAS (APV SBAS) or by a precision approach system.
Only the Type B (3D) approaches are further divided into the following categories of approach:
Category I (CAT I)
Category II (CAT II)
Category IIIA (CAT IIIA)
Category IIIB (CAT IIIB)
Category IIIC (CAT IIIC)

Refer to figures and/or to chart E(LO)13 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
You are planning a flight from Ajaccio (LFKJ) to Marina di Campo (LIRJ), routing along airways A9 and L146. Extract the information from the chart and complete the navigation plan. What will be the total distance and estimated flight time?

Images:
- images/AT00077_img_1.png
- images/AT00077_img_2.png

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
Identify the route on the chart, then to fill in the gaps in the navigation plan, we need the true track of BTA to MOULE and MOULE to XOPTA. Both of these tracks are the same, and the magnetic track is 075º, so with magnetic variation of 2ºE, the true track is 077º.
Then using the CRP-5 or other navigation computer, calculate the required heading to fly 077º track. The true heading of 076º equals a magnetic heading of 074º. The navigation computer gives a groundspeed of 150 kt.
The missing distances from the navigation plan can be found next to the airway line on the chart, 13 nm from BTA to MOULE and 5nm from MOULE to XOPTA.
At 150 kt groundspeed, the time from BTA to MOULE is (13/150) x 60 = 5.2 minutes (round to 5 minutes). The time from MOULE to XOPTA is (5/150) x 60 = 2 minutes.
Adding up the distances for each leg gives us a total of 123 nm and adding up the times gives a total of 57 minutes

Question Number: AT00080
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

How much additional fuel should be carried based on the following critical points along your flight?
ETP1: FOB: 8100 kg, CFS: 8260 kg
ETP2: FOB: 6250 kg, CFS: 6360 kg

Explanation:
Additional fuel is essential for ensuring the safety of a flight in case of emergencies. It is calculated to allow an aircraft to reach an alternate airport from the most critical point along its route. In the event of an emergency, the aircraft should have enough fuel to fly to the alternate, hold at an altitude of 1500 feet AGL for 15 minutes, and then safely execute an approach and landing.
To calculate this, you must find the difference between the block fuel and critical fuel scenario. If the fuel required for the trip is greater than the fuel required for the critical fuel scenario, there is no need to take additional fuel, however if it is not enough, the difference between must then be added as additional fuel.
ETP stands for estimated time of passage, for example estimated time of passing over waypoint 1 e.g. ETP1.
For this scenario, there are 2 critical points along the flight. At ETP1, you would have 8100 kg of fuel left to reach your destination but in case of an emergency you would need 8260 kg to reach your alternate airport, hold and land. In this case, the difference in fuel (8260 - 8100 = 160 kg) should be added as additional fuel.
The same calculation should be done for ETP2: 6360 - 6250 = 110 kg.
The higher of the two differences (160 kg from ETP1) should be used for the additional fuel, ensuring that the aircraft will have enough fuel to handle either emergency scenario and safely reach the alternate airport.

A. A
110 kg
B. B

A crew finds that the actual headwind is stronger than the forecast wind, and so flies at 140 kt TAS instead of the planned 130 kt TAS to minimise the delay to arrival. Determine the increase in fuel use for the flight leg, given:
Fuel flow at 130 kt TAS: 162 kg/h
Fuel flow at 140 kt TAS: 188 kg/h
Forecast headwind component: 10 kt
Actual headwind component: 25 kt
Leg distance: 166 NM

Explanation:
1) Determine the planned fuel consumed flying at 130 kt TAS:
Planned TAS: 130 kt
Forecast headwind: 10 kt
Therefore, the planned ground speed = 120 kt
Planned flight time (to cover 166 NM) = 166 NM / 120 kt = 1 h 23 min
Fuel flow at 130 kt TAS = 162 kg/h
Planned fuel consumed = 162 kg/h x 1 h 23 min = 224 kg
2) Determine the actual fuel consumed flying at 140 kt TAS:
Actual TAS: 140 kt
Actual headwind: 25 kt
Therefore, the actual ground speed = 115 kt
Actual flight time (to cover 166 NM) = 166 NM / 115 kt = 1 h 26 min
Fuel flow at 140 kt TAS = 188 kg/h
Actual fuel consumed = 188 kg/h x 1 h 26 min = 271 kg
3) Determine the fuel increase:
271 kg - 224 kg = 47 kg

Options:
A. A
15 kg

Question Number: AT00085
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

How much is the clearance passing the highest obstacle in the following scenario? An aircraft is flying at FL170 in mountainous terrain on the northern side of the alps and the charted minimum grid-area altitude is 16200 feet.
The outside air temperature at FL170 is -29°C
The QNH is 1000.25 hPa given by a meteorological station with elevation 13500 feet.
Assume 1hPa = 30 feet

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1000 hPa = 13 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 13 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­390 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude = 17 000 ft - 390 ft = 16 610 ft.
To determine the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for the given flight level/altitude (FL170). In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is therefore: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (17 000/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of ­­­-19 ºC. The actual outside air temperature is ­­­-29 ºC, which means we have an ISA deviation of ISA -10ºC.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -10ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 16 610 ft - 13 500 ft = 3 110 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-10) × (3 110/1000) = 124 ft.
The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 16 610 ft - 124 ft = ­­­­­16 486 ft.
The charted minimum grid altitude 16 200 ft in a mountainous terrain means that, an aircraft flying within this grid clears the highest obstacle by 2 000 ft. Thus, the highest obstacle is at: 16 200 ft - 2 000 ft = 14 200 ft.
Therefore, the aircraft clears the obstacle by: 16 486 ft - 14 200 ft = 2 286 ft.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.

Refer to figures or to Stuttgart charts 10-3P and 10-3C from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
The pilot is advised by ATC to expect either DKB 9B RNAV SID (OVERLAY) or DKB 9B SID. Which of the following applies to DKB 9B RNAV SID (OVERLAY)?

Images:
- images/AT00088_img_1.png
- images/AT00088_img_2.png

Explanation:
In this case, from looking at the charts in question, the departure can be done using conventional nav aids, but there is a RNAV overlay departure, where the intended departure is programmed to be flown by the aircraft's lateral navigation system instead of using the conventional nav aids.
This mostly uses GPS, as that is the most reliable and accurate source of navigation that an aircraft usually has available, and this system makes the pilots jobs much easier than a conventional departure.
As for the other options;
The DKB 9B RNAV SID (OVERLAY) departure may only be flown as RNAV, as per the chart in use. It cannot be flown using conventional navaids only.
It does not mention what RNAV certification is required on the plate, and might not be RNAV 1.
The ADF is not required to be serviceable

Options:
A. A
It may be flown only with reference to VOR and DME.
B. B
It requires both the pilots and the aircraft to have an RNAV 1 certification.
C. C
It requires the on-board ADF to be serviceable.

Question Number: AT00089
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aeroplane with reciprocating engines is planning to depart for an isolated destination Aerodrome as a Commercial Air Transport operation. Calculate the minimum amount of fuel required (to the nearest 10 kg), when overhead the isolated aerodrome, considering the following details.
Flight time: 2 hours and 30 minutes
Top of climb to top of descent time: 2 hours
Normal fuel consumption cruise: 780 kg per hour
Alternate fuel: to fly for 45 minutes plus 15% of the flying time planned to be spent at cruising level

Explanation:
Isolated aerodrome is one for which the alternate and final fuel reserve required to the nearest adequate destination alternate aerodrome is more than:
for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes plus 15% of the flying time planned to be spent at cruising level or two hours, whichever is less or
for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for two hours at normal cruise consumption above the destination aerodrome, including final reserve fuel.
1) Fuel to fly for 45 minutes plus 15% of the planned flight time at cruising level is:
45 min at 780 kg/hr: 45/60 hr x 780 kg/hr = 585 kg
15% of 2 hours cruise with 780 kg/hr: 15% x (2 hr x 780 kg/hr) = 234 kg
Totally, 585 kg + 234 kg = 819 kg, rounded to nearest 10 kg, becomes 820 kg.
2) And, fuel to fly for 2 hours is: 2 hr x 780 kg/hr = 1560 kg.
Therefore, the minimum amount of fuel required when overhead the Isolated aerodrome is the lower between 1) and 2); 820 kg.

Options:

Refer to figure.
Determine the amount of the Final Reserve Fuel (FINRES) for this Commercial Air Transport jet aircraft.

Images:
- images/AT00090_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Take-off fuel (T/OFF FUEL) = Trip fuel + Contingency fuel (CONT) + Alternate (ALTN) + Final Reserve fuel (FINRES) + Extra fuel (EXTRA)
Therefore:
Final Reserve fuel (FINRES) = T/OFF FUEL - (TRIP + CONT + ALTN + EXTRA)
In order to make the above calculation, we must determine the Contingency Fuel:
Fuel flow at holding speed is not given, therefore we will assume contingency to be 5% of trip fuel
Contingency Fuel = 5% x 15 320 kg = 766 kg
We can now calculate the Final reserve fuel:
Final Reserve fuel (FINRES) = 19 764 kg - (15 320 kg + 766 kg + 1 504 kg + 1 000 kg)
Final Reserve fuel (FINRES) = 1 174 kg

Images:
- images/AT00091_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
At the top right of the plate, in the instructions box, you can find key information needed to solve this exercise:
Clearance limit is SUGOL;
Unless otherwise instructed, MAX 250 kt at IAF.
The distance from MOLIX to SUGAL equals:
MOLIX ⇒ LUTEX (17 NM)
+ LUTEX ⇒ ROBVI (13 NM)
+ ROBVI ⇒ SUGOL (7.5 NM)
= 37.5 NM
The ground speed is 250 kt. Therefore, the time taken to cover 37.5 NM is: (37.5 NM ÷ 250 kt) x 60 = 9 minutes.

Given the following information and based on the actual time overhead B, what will be the Estimated Time of Overflight (ETO) and estimated remaining fuel at waypoint C? Fuel flow: 900 lb/h

Images:
- images/AT00092_img_1.png

Explanation:
Estimated flight time from Departure to "B" = 30 min (ATO 1140 - ETO 1210)
Estimated fuel burn = 450 lb (2800 lb - 2350 lb)
Actual flight time = 34 min (ATO 1140 - ATO 1214)
Actual fuel burn = 510 lb (2800 lb - 2290 lb)
Which gives a fuel consumption of 510 lb / 34 min = 900 lb/h
Second leg "B - C" is twice as long (distance) as the first leg (departure - B):
Flight time = 2 x 34 min = 68 min = 1h 08
ETO = 12h 14 + 1h 08 = 13h 22
Fuel burn = 1h 08 x 900 lb/h = 1020 lb
Fuel remaining = 2290 lb - 1020 lb = 1270 lb

Options:
A. B
ETO 13:10, and estimated remaining fuel 1450 lb.
B. C
ETO 13:22, and estimated remaining fuel 1450 lb.

Question Number: AT00094
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A pilot of a Commercial Air Transport operations company is planning to conduct an IFR flight from Departure aerodrome A, where a VOR approach can be only conducted with visibility below the landing minima, to a Destination aerodrome B above the planning minima but in IMC. Which considerations must be taken into account by the pilot during the pre-flight planning procedure, so as to determine the minimum fuel required, regarding that the above forecast conditions at both aerodromes are expected to remain the same?

Explanation:
The weather at destination aerodrome is above the operating minima and is expected to remain the same.
Operating Mimima means minima for the IFR approach available, i.e. CAT ILS.
Planning Mimima for a destination aerodrome are effectively the applicable approach operating minima. The RVR or visibility should be the same as or greater than the minima for the actual approach for a non-precision approach.
Planning minima for alternate aerodromes are not the same as the aerodrome operating minima. Generally, higher cloud bases and visibilities are required than the minima. Thus, an alternate aerodrome with a CAT II approach allowing an RVR of 300 m would not be suitable for use as an alternate, unless the weather conditions were CAT I, 550 m RVR or better (allowing a safety margin).
During the pre-flight planning procedure, the pilot must consider:
Weather at Destination above Operating minima at ETA ± 1 hour.
Weather at Destination Alternate above Planning minima at ETA ± 1 hour.
Weather at Take-off Alternate Operating minima at ETA ± 1 hour.
And after Take-off:
Weather at Destination must be above Operating minima at ETA.
Weather at Destination Alternate must be above Planning minima at ETA.
Also, for a twin-engine aircraft, a Take-off alternate within 60 minutes flying time of the Deparure aerodrome with One-Engine-Inoperative must be considered.
Therefore, the destination aerodrome can be considered as the Take-off alternate, thus no Additional fuel is required.

Options:
A. A
The pilot must select a destination alternate aerodrome that is within 1 hour's flight time from the destination aerodrome, and carry sufficient Alternate Fuel to reach that following an approach at the destination.
B. B
The pilot must select two destination alternate aerodromes and carry sufficient Alternate Fuel to reach both aerodromes following an approach at the destination.
C. C
NO destination alternate aerodrome is required as the weather at the destination aerodrome is forecast to remain above the planning minima, avoiding the need for Alternate Fuel.
D. D
The pilot must select a take-off alternate aerodrome, which could be the destination aerodrome if operational minima permit, avoiding the need for Additional Fuel. ✓ (CORRECT)

Correct Answer: D.

Question Number: AT00095
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

During a navigation flight, the pilot makes in-flight checks to monitor the progress of the flight. During the last leg, he/she notices that the planned timings overhead the chosen waypoints are NOT corresponding to the actual timings, and that the aircraft is getting behind the timings. Both the planned and actual airspeed are 160 kt. What is the main reason for the deviation from the planned timings?

Explanation:
If the planned and actual airspeed are both 160 kt, and the pilot notices that the planned timings overhead the chosen waypoints are not corresponding to the actual timings, and that the aircraft is getting behind the timings, the main reason for the deviation from the planned timings is likely to be a headwind or tailwind component.
Wind is a major factor that affects the progress of a flight, and it can cause a deviation from the planned timings. A headwind component will slow down the aircraft and increase the flight time, while a tailwind component will speed up the aircraft and decrease the flight time.
The pilot should check the current wind conditions and make the necessary adjustments to the flight plan, such as adjusting the planned ground speed, fuel consumption, and arrival time. If the wind conditions are significantly different from those forecasted, the pilot may also consider diverting to an alternate airport or requesting a new clearance from ATC.

Options:
A. A
The actual fuel consumption is different to the planned consumption.
B. B
The increase in aerodynamic drag resulting in a slower groundspeed.
C. D
The actual groundspeed is faster than that calculated during the planning phase.
D. C
The actual wind (direction or speed) is different to the forecast wind. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00096
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Which statement is correct regarding the altimeter temperature error correction during a final approach to an aerodrome?

Explanation:
The altimeter is calibrated to standard atmosphere conditions and most of the time the environment is close enough to standard for any temperature induced errors to be minimal.
When the environment is warmer than standard, the aircraft will be higher than indicated, usually a safe error.
When the environment is colder than standard, the aircraft will be lower than indicated and this potentially a dangerous error. Temperature errors need to be taken into account when landing in very cold conditions. A temperature correction to the DH/DA or MDA/MDH and step-down fixes inside the Final Approach Fix (FAF) must be added in this case.
According to ICAO-Doc 8168-Vol.1-Flight Procedures-Part 1-Section 4-Ch. 1:
The flight crew is responsible for any necessary Temperature Error Correction to all all published minimum altitudes/heights including the altitudes/heights for the initial and intermediate segments; the DA/DH and subsequent missed approach altitudes/heights except for APV/BARO-VNAV approach procedures.
NOTE: The pilot is not responsible for temperature error corrections, when being radar vectored by ATC or when issued a direct routing. But this does not relieve the pilot of the responsibilty that any clearances issued by ATC are safe.

Options:
A. A
Temperature error correction should be applied when the aerodrome temperature is much lower than ISA and subtracted from the DH/DA or MDH/MDA and step-down fixes inside the FAF.
B. B
Temperature error correction should be applied when the aerodrome temperature is ISA and below and subtracted only from the DH/DA or MDH/MDA.
C. D
Temperature error correction should be applied when the aerodrome temperature is ISA and below and added only to the DH/DA and MDH/MDA.
D. C
Temperature error correction should be applied when the aerodrome temperature is much lower than ISA and added to the DH/DA or MDH/MDA and step-down fixes inside the FAF. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00097
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft is routing in IMC towards Aberdeen aerodrome from the south-east, where the Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA) is 2500 feet. While routing towards the ATF NDB at 3000 feet on the Aberdeen QNH, the following instruction is received by the pilot from the Approach Radar controller:
‘’Turn left, heading 285 degrees, descend 2300 feet. Radar vectors for the ILS Runway 34’’.
The pilot should…

Explanation:
Radar vectoring means giving the pilot specific headings to maintain the desired track. When "under vectors" or "under radar control", it means that a radar control service is being provided, i.e. the PIC must do what he is told by the radar unit and the ATC assumes responsibility for separation and terrain clearance in flight, providing bearing, distance and height information on known conflicting traffic. Some services will also provide advisory avoiding action.
Thus, the PIC when "under vectors", should follow the ATC's instructions.
In a radar environment, heading information given by the pilot and heading instructions given by the controllers are in degrees magnetic.
Minimum Radar Vectoring Altitude (MRVA), also known as Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA), is the lowest alltitude, expressed in feet AMSL, to which a radar controller may issue aircraft altitude clearances during vectoring. MRVA allows the ATC to vector and descent an aircraft below MSA to achieve VFR or to join a procedure.
Therefore, the pilot should turn left to head 285°(M) and descend to 2300 feet. The minimum radar vectoring altitude may be below MSA.

Options:
A. A
Maintain heading and altitude, and request new descent instructions, because 2300 feet is below MSA.
B. C
Turn left to head 285°(M) but maintain 3000 feet and request new descent instructions, because 2300 feet is below MSA.
C. D
Turn left to head 285°(T) and descend to 2500 feet altitude, because this is the MSA. Inform the controller about the change.
D. B
Turn left to head 285°(M) and descend to 2300 feet. The minimum radar vectoring altitude may be below MSA. ✓ (CORRECT)

What will be the effect of an incorrect cruise level entry into the FMC?

Explanation:
Although the use of GNSS/FMC equipment has resulted in IFR navigation being much more accurate and less time consuming for the pilots, the systems can still suffer from errors and inaccuracies due to limitations such as the information and calculations provided by these systems are dependent upon the accurate input of data from the pilots and/or navigation database. Therefore, it is vital to ensure that the information input into the system is correct, especially when rerouting.
The Flight Management Computer (FMC) restricts the input of a cruising altitude that is not achievable based on the aircraft's weight and the prevailing temperature conditions. However, while in cruise, the FMC continuously recalculates the aircraft's performance data based on the air data and weight to determine if a climb to a higher altitude is feasible.
Entering an incorrect cruise level into the FMC can have significant consequences. The FMC uses the entered cruise level to calculate various parameters, including speeds, times, and fuel flows. If the cruise level is incorrect, these calculations will be based on inaccurate information. This can lead to incorrect flight performance predictions and affect the efficiency and accuracy of the aircraft's operation.

Options:
A. A
The incorrect entry will be detected and the input will be prevented.
B. B
The aircraft will NOT be able to reach the ATC assigned cruise level.
C. C
There will be NO effect as the FMC will make an automatic correction.
D. D
The FMC will calculate incorrect speeds, times and fuel flows. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00101

What is the vertical distance flown for a climb from a departure aerodrome with elevation 3 500 ft and QNH 1030 hPa until a cruise altitude at FL250?
(Assume 30 ft per 1 hPa)

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1030 hPa - 1013 hPa = 17 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­510 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude = 25 000 ft + 510 ft = 25 510 ft.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. In this case, the temperature is not provided, therefore we will assume ISA conditions.
Thus, the height of the aircraft above airfield datum will be: True Altitude - Airfield datum elevation = 25 510 - 3 500 ft = 22 010 ft.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Refer to figure or to Amsterdam chart 10-3C from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
An aircraft is cleared for the ANDIK2F SID to an altitude of 6000 ft and is then is reauthorized to climb to FL330. You are climbing with an average TAS of 381 kts and a 20 kt tailwind. The climb is 103 NAM (Nautical Air Miles). What is the total distance covered after waypoint ANDIK until top-of-climb?

Images:
- images/AT00103_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The distance from take-off until ANDIK is 2.4 + 1 + 9 + 20 = 32.4 NGM. (There is no indication for the distance from take-off until EH019)
We must first calculate how much distance we will cover to reach FL330:
NAM = NGM x (TAS/GS)
NGM = NAM x (GS/TAS)
NGM = 103 x (401/381)
NGM = 108.4 NGM
We can now calculate how far after ANDIK the aircraft will reach FL330:
108.4 NGM - 32.4 NGM = 76 NGM
The aircraft will reach FL330 76 NGM after ANDIK.

Question Number: AT00106
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A Commercial Air Transport flight of 3 hours total flight time is planned to an aerodrome where no alternate is required. 1.5 hours after take-off, the pilot is informed that there will be a delay due to traffic on arriving at destination, thus he/she has to use 8 minutes out of the 15 minutes additional fuel. What action should be done in this case?

Explanation:
Additional fuel is an amount of fuel which is only applicable to some operations and it can cater for the “what ifs” at the most critical point.
1. According to EASA AIR OPS - CAT.OP.MPA.280 In-flight fuel management – aeroplanes:
The operator shall establish a procedure to ensure that in-flight fuel checks and fuel management are carried out according to the following criteria.
(b) In-flight fuel management
(1) The flight shall be conducted so that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is not less than:
(i) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel; or
(ii) the final reserve fuel if no alternate aerodrome is required.
(2) If an in-flight fuel check shows that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is less than:
(ii) the final reserve fuel if no alternate aerodrome is required, the commander shall take appropriate action and proceed to an adequate aerodrome so as to perform a safe landing with not less than final reserve fuel.
2. According to AMC1-CAT.OP.MPA.150(b)-Fuel Policy Planning Criteria-Aeroplanes:
(6) The minimum additional fuel, which should permit:
(ii) holding for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft (450 m) above destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, when a flight is operated without a destination alternate aerodrome.
Since it is expected that only 8 out of the 15 minutes will be burnt on arriving at destination due to traffic, that means that the aircraft is expected to land with the final reserve fuel in tanks.
Thus, the best action is to proceed to the destination given that the aircraft can land with final reserve fuel intact.

Options:
A. A
Check the weather and if within minima proceed to the destination.
B. B
Proceed to an in-flight re-planning at a destination alternate.
C. C
Declare an emergency when arriving at destination and ask for a priority clearance.
D. D
Proceed to the destination given that the aircraft can land with final reserve fuel intact. ✓ (CORRECT)

Refer to figure.
The annex depicts a pilot's flight log from LPFR to LEMG extracted by a flight planning software. When approaching VJF, the pilots feels abnormal airframe vibrations and reduces speed from VJF. Their IAS and TAS both decrease by 30 kt. What will be the new leg times of Tarifa to Estepona and Estepona to Benalmaneda?

Images:
- images/AT00109_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Keeping this as simple as possible, if the TAS decreases by 30 kt then the GS will decrease by 30 kt also, which gives us an expected GS of 87 kt to Estepona, 85 kt to TOD then 88 kt to Benalmadena. There are more precise methods to do this, but given the spread of the options, this is absolutely the fastest way to get the correct answer
To Estepona
With a GS of 87 kt, the 32.6 nm leg to Estepona will now take (32.6/87) x 60 = 22.5 minutes.
To TOD
With a GS of 85 kt, the 30.9 nm leg to TOD will now take (30.9/85) x 60 = 21.8 minutes.
To Benalmadena
With a GS of 88 kt the 0.9 nm leg to Benalmadena will now take (0.9/88) x 60 = 0.6 minutes.
Tarifa to Estepona 22.5 min.
Estepona To Benalmadena 21.8 + 0.6 = 22.4 min.
The closest answer here is 23 min and 23 min.

Question Number: AT00110
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Which of the following circumstances would be considered suitable for fuel tankering?
1. The estimated landing mass is equal to the maximum landing mass.
2. The weather at the destination is below landing minima.
3. Unable to climb to the Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA) should an engine fail.
4. There is no fuel available at the destination aerodrome.

Explanation:
Aviation is a very competitive market and each airline needs to minimise operating costs, in order to keep its ticket prices as competitive as possible. Fuel tankering is a practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its next flight (trip fuel + reserve) in order to reduce or avoid refuelling at the destination airport. However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions.
Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the break even fuel price.
You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if:
Adverse destination weather The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome
Fuel shortages at destination
Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop
The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass

Question Number: AT00111
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to figure.
The figure depicts a fuel plan as created by a flight planning tool for a return flight LFPG-EIDW-LFPG. During the pre-flight preparations, the Operations Department calls the pilot and advises him/her to refuel at LFPG, due to some fuel-supply issues at EIDW. In order to reduce the environmental impact, the pilot will consider the least possible fuel tankering. What is the MINIMUM amount of fuel tankering to ensure the target fuel for EIDW-LFPG remains on board after landing at EIDW?

Images:
- images/AT00111_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The Minimum Block Fuel that is required at EIDW to return to LFPG is: 7 100 kg.
We will assume that trip, contingency* and taxi fuel will be burnt: 230 kg + 2 933 kg + 157 kg = 3 320 kg.
* We should assume contingency is burnt, because if we do use it, we will below minimum block fuel for the return.
For the flight LFPG-EIDW, the crew have loaded a total of 5 226 kg. This means they will land at EIDW with 1 906 kg onboard (after burning taxi, contingency and trip fuel).
For the flight back (EIDW - LFPG), the crew needs a minimum block fuel of 7 100 kg. Therefore, at LFPG, they should load 7 100 kg - 1 906 kg = 5 194 kg extra.
However, carrying more fuel, adds weight to the aircraft and increases the fuel consumption. So, the fuel penalty from LFPG to EIDW must be applied. For every weight change per 1 000 kg, add 60 Kg to the Total fuel: 5 194 kg / 1 000 x 60 kg = 312 kg.
Therefore, the Minimum fuel amount that must be tankered, after applying the Fuel Penalty at LFPG must be: 5 194 kg + 312 kg = 5 506 kg.

Question Number: AT00112
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A flight from aerodrome A to aerodrome B is planned using the Reduced Contingency Fuel Procedure. The decision point along the route is DP and aerodrome C is the optional refuelling destination. Given the following data calculate the minimum fuel required for the flight from A to B.
Taxi Fuel: 250 kg
Alternate Fuel: 2000 kg
Final Reserve Fuel: 1500
Trip Fuel A to B via DP: 13000 kg
Trip Fuel A to C via DP: 11000 kg
Trip Fuel DP to B: 5000 kg

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
When an operator's fuel policy includes pre-flight using Reduced Contingency Fuel (RCF) procedure to a Destination 1 aerodrome (commercial destination), a Decision Point (DP) will be defined enroute along with a Destination 2 aerodrome (optional refuelling destination), the amount of usable fuel, on board for departure, shall be the greater of (1) or (2) below:
(1) The sum of:
Taxi fuel: 250 kg
Trip fuel to the destination B aerodrome, via the decision point: 13000 kg
Contingency fuel equal to not less than 5 % of the estimated fuel consumption from the decision point to the destination 1 aerodrome: 5% x 5000 kg = 250 kg
Alternate fuel: 2000 kg
Final reserve fuel: 1500 kg
Additional fuel: 0
Extra fuel: 0
RCF1: 17 000 kg
(2) The sum of:
Taxi fuel: 250 kg
Trip fuel to the destination C aerodrome, via the decision point: 11000 kg
Contingency fuel equal to not less than the amount that is calculated in accordance with point (c)* of this AMC, from the departure aerodrome to the destination 2 aerodrome; 11000 kg x 5% = 550 kg
or
an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions: In this case, the question does not provide fuel flow, so we are unable to calculate this.
Alternate fuel: 2000 kg
Final reserve fuel: 1500 kg,
Additional fuel: 0
Extra fuel: 0
RCF2: 15 300kg
The greater sum between RCF1 and RCF2 is RCF1: 17 000 kg.
Note: 95 % of the time RCF 1 (A to B) will require the largest total fuel. However, always calculate RCF 2, because there are questions where that is the largest.

Refer to figure.
The flight crew of a turbojet aeroplane prepares a flight using the following data.
Flight leg distance: 4 000 NM
Flight level FL 310
True airspeed: 450 kt
Headwind component at this level: 50 kt
Initially planned take-off mass (without extra fuel on board): 170 000 kg
Fuel price: 0.27 Euro/l at departure 0.30 Euro/l at destination
To maximize savings, the commander chooses to carry extra fuel in addition to that which is necessary. Using the appended annex, the optimum quantity of fuel which should be carried in addition to the prescribed quantity is:

Images:
- images/AT00114_img_1.png
- images/AT00114_img_2.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
To enter the table we first need to know fuel/price ratio and distance in NAM:
Calculate the fuel/price ratio. Use the formula: fuel/price ratio = Fuel price at departure/Fuel price at destination
Fuel/price ratio = 0.27 ÷ 0.30 = 0.9
Convert NGM into NAM. Use the formula: NAM = NGM x TAS ÷ GS
NAM = 4 000 x 450/400 = 4500 NAM
Using the table provided, find your optimum aircraft mass for tankering purposes:
1. Enter the table on the left-hand side with your fuel price ratio of 0.90.
2. Draw a horizontal line to the right, intersect with the Air Distance Covered: 4500 NM.
3. From this point, continue downwards and read an optimum aircraft mass of 178 000 kg.
With regards to this question, planned take-off mass: 170 000 kg => from this result we could say that tankering would be beneficial => an additional 8 000 kg (178 000 kg - 170 000 kg) should be carried.
Note: If the actual Take-off Mass is higher, there would be no economic benefit in tankering.

Question Number: AT00115
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

What is the difference between GNSS planned and unplanned outages?

Explanation:
Notice Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU) is an advisory message to inform users of a change in the GPS constellation. These messages are released 72 hours in advance of planned maintenance. These messages are also used to notify users of unscheduled outages. General NANUs can be used to disseminate general GPS information.
Outages come in two varieties: planned and unplanned.
Planned are all the activities/events that have been scheduled and that could potentially have an impact on the Signal-in-Space (SiS) and/or the performance levels. Planned NAGUs aim to inform users about the activity/event with a reasonable advance notice, ahead of their occurrence. The planned outages, in space or ground segment, can potentially cause an outage of the broadcast satellite SiS. A planned outage will be announced ahead of time and usually means some sort of maintenance is taking place.
Unplanned are all the activities/events that have an impact on the SiS and/or the performance levels that have not been scheduled and could not be foreseen in advance, before their occurrence. The aim of unplanned NAGUs is to inform users about the activity/event within a reasonable time, after their occurrence.
The difference between the planned and unplanned outages of GPS is that a planned outage is well recognisable during flight preparation, because relevant monitoring tools and NOTAMs will most probably indicate some problems. On the other hand, in case of unplanned outage, it is possible that the pilot will become aware mid-flight that integrity is lost. Therefore, the pilot should develop and maintain good practise in using backup conventional navigation whenever possible.

Options:
A. A
Unplanned outages are notified weekly.
B. B
Unplanned outages are NOT notified.
C. D
Planned outages are not notified.
D. C

Refer to chart E(LO)2 from Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
Find the magnetic bearing and distance from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME (53°03'N, 001°40'W) to waypoint AMVEL (53°11'N, 000° 02'W).

Images:
- images/AT00116_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
For this question you need a plotter to find the true bearing initially and a ruler to measure the distance between Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL.
Firstly, find the exact position of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL on your E(LO)2 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points.
Center your plotter at the centre of Trent (TNT) VOR/DME symbol, since the question asks for the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME.
Align the upper section of your plotter with the drawn line which connects the two points.
Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North.
The course arrow indicates the true bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL: 082oT.
Variation is 001oW, thus the magnetic bearing from Trent (TNT) VOR/DME to waypoint AMVEL is: 082oT+ 1o = 083o M(Variation West, Magnetic Best).
Furthermore, it is known that the E(LO)2 chart's scale is "1 INCH = 15 NM", depicted on the upper section of the chart. So, using a ruler, you will find that the distance in inches between Trent (TNT) VOR/DME and waypoint AMVEL is 37/8 inches. Thus, the distance in nautical miles is approximately 58.1 NM.
Therefore, the closest to the above findings option is: 084°M / 59 NM.

Refer to figure.
After the pre-flight preparation, the flight plan log shown in the annex was completed, taking into account the meteorological conditions for the scheduled Estimated Time of Departure at 07:30 UTC. Due to the passage of a cold front, a delay is expected for 3 hours. What will be the revised Groundspeed between WPT B and WPT C because of the expected delay?

Images:
- images/AT00117_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
Because of the 3-hour delay, the Estimated Time of Departure will be at 10:30 UTC. Thus, the right hand wind and temperature forecast table should be taken into account. So, there will be differentiation to the TAS and as a consequence to the Groundspeed from Waypoint B to C, because of the new OAT (M25).
Using your Flight/Nav computer, find the new TAS at FL100:
In the Airspeed correction window, align FL100 with OAT -25ºC.
Opposite CAS 155 kt on inner scale, read TAS 173 kt on outer scale.
Using again your Flight/Nav computer, find the new Groundspeed: TAS 173 kt, Wind 165°(T)/55kt, True Track 245° from the flight plan/log:
Set wind direction 165º under the True index.
Mark wind velocity 55 kt up from the centre dot.
Rotate the disc until the true course 245º is under the True index.
Slide wind velocity mark to TAS 173 kt.
New Goundspeed 155 kt reads under the centre dot.

An aircraft being operated for a Commercial Air Transport flight has an Approach Climb Gradient (ACG) capability of 3.7%. Three instrument approach procedures are available and listed below. Which of these could be selected for that flight?
1. ILS/DME APP, minimum ACG required is 3.0%
2. LOC/DME APP, minimum ACG required is 3.7%
3. VOR/DME APP, minimum ACG required is 4.2%

Explanation:
The missed or discontinued approach is defined as a go-around from at or above decision height (DH) with one engine inoperative. This is also called “approach climb”.
The requirement for Approach climb gradient assures that ''an adequate performance for a go-around exists in the event of an engine failure''.
For instrument approaches the pilot should verify that the Approach Climb Gradient (ACG) capability allows for a missed approach. Therefore, the selected instrument approach procedure must have a minimum ACG requirement equal or less than the aircraft’s ACG capability.
For an ACG capability of 3.7%, the only instrument procedures that assure a safe missed approach are those with a minimum ACG equal or less than 3.7%.
Therefore, only 1.ILS/DME APP or 2.LOC/DME APP can be selected, which require minimum ACG capability 3.0% and 3.7% correspondingly.

Refer to figure.
A twin-engine jet aeroplane cruises at FL370. Given the following information, what is the fuel required for the remainder of the cruise time?
Mass: 52 500 kg
Cruise Altitude: FL370
Distance to Top-of-Descent: 150 NM
TAT: -42°C
Wind: 25 kt head
Consider a constant aircraft mass of 52 500 kg for calculation purposes.

Images:
- images/AT00123_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
For this question, interpolate between the "55 000 kg" and the "50 000 kg" columns at the "37 000" block and apply the corrections given above the table, if required:
The fuel flow for a mass of 52 500 kg is: 963.5 kg/hr per engine, so for both engines is: 1 927 kg/hr.
Because of TAT (-42°C) below the Standard TAT (-32°C) by 10°C, decrease the fuel flow by 3%: 1 927 kg/hr - 58 kg/hr = 1 869 kg/hr.
Also, the TAS at FL370 for a mass of 52 500 kg is: 432 kt, but because of TAT below the Standard TAT by 10°C, it decreases to: 432 kt - 10 kt = 422 kt.
The aeroplane experiences a 25 kt headwind, thus GS = TAS - 25 kt = 422 kt - 25 kt = 397 kt.
So, the required cruise time to cover the cruise distance of 150 NM is: Distance / TAS = 150 NM / 397 kt = 0.38 hr.
Therefore, the fuel consupmtion will be: Fuel flow x Cruise time = 1 869 kg/hr x 0.38 hr = 710 kg.
Closest option: 707 kg

The purpose of the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is to ensure the (1) _____ of the GNSS navigation signals. For the RAIM function, at least one additional (2) _____ needs to be available to determine with precision its actual position and known potential error.

Explanation:
Because the satellites are monitored from the ground, it may take some time before the users become aware of a malfunction in the system. So, at present, two methods exist within airborne equipment to provide integrity of navigation under these circumstances:
Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM).
Aircraft Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (AAIM).
RAIM provides integrity monitoring of GPS signals. To do so, it needs an extra satellite, to the 4 required for a position calculation. So a minimum of 5 satellites are totally required with satisfactory geometry. This extra satellite is used to compare positions from the satellites and detect faults in the pseudorange measurements.
The FMS uses RAIM to exclude a GPS satellite that is giving contradictory information to the rest of the constellation.

Given the following information for a Commercial Air Transport operation, calculate the maximum possible Extra Fuel to be uplifted.
Maximum Zero Fuel Mass: 62731 kg
Actual Zero Fuel Mass: 62700 kg
Regulated Take-Off Mass: 76000 kg
Maximum Landing Mass: 66360 kg
Fuel Tank Capacity: 16000 kg
Taxi Fuel: 240 kg
Trip Fuel: 10000 kg
Minimum Block Fuel: 13100 kg

Explanation:
In order to find out the amount of fuel which can be uplifted you have to calculate the MTOM, MLM and tank capacity limitation - the most limiting value obtained from these calculations will be the maximum fuel which can be uplifted.
Note: MZFM does not limit fuel.
BASED ON REGULATED TAKE OFF MASS (RTOM):
RTOM – (ATOM) = 76 000 kg - 75 560 kg = 440 kg
ATOM = AZFM + Take Off fuel = 62 700 kg + (13 100 kg - 240 kg) = 75 560 kg
* Take Off fuel = Minimum Block Fuel - Taxi Fuel
BASED ON MAXIMUM LANDING MASS (MLM):
MLM – Landing mass = 66 360 kg - 65 560 kg = 800 kg
LM = ATOM - Trip fuel = 75 560 kg - 10 000 kg = 65 560 kg
BASED ON TANK CAPACITY:
16 000 kg - 13 100 kg = 2 900 kg
=> The most restricting value in based on REGULATED TAKE OFF MASS (RTOM): 440 kg.

Refer to AMSTERDAM - Chart 10-3Q from Jeppesen GSPRM 2017. What does EHØ48 indicate?

Images:
- images/AT00129_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
A fly-by waypoint is a waypoint where the turn is started just before the waypoint is reached so that the arc of the turn comes closest to the direct track to and from the waypoint. A fly-over waypoint is as it says, the aircraft has to actually pass overhead the waypoint before taking up the course for the next leg. A fly-by waypoint allows the turn to start just before the waypoint overhead - turn anticipation.
This is the standard turning method for FMS and INS systems and represents the most efficient turn.
A fly-over waypoint is the point at which a turn is initiated in order to join the next segment of a route or procedure. A fly-over waypoint requires the aircraft to actually get to the waypoint before the turn is initiated and therefore there is always an element of overshoot.
The symbols for a fly-by and a fly-over waypoint in aeronautical maps and charts can be differenciated by the circle surrounding fly-over waypoints.
According to the route description at the bottom section of the AMSTERDAM (EHAM) 10-3Q chart, all aircraft, apart from B737, must fly overhead EHØ48.
Therefore, for all aircraft other than B737, the EHØ48 RNAV waypoint is fly-by. But for B737 aircraft EHØ8Ø RNAV waypoint is a fly-over one.

Distance : 100 NM
TAS : 350 kt
Wind : 030°/100 kt

Explanation:
First step of our calculation is going to involve the calculation of the head/tailwind component. Knowing our true course and the wind, we can easily calculate the wind components using a formula: cos (wind angle) × wind speed. In our case the course = 090° and the wind is reported at 030° / 100 kts. Therefore, the wind angle is 60° (90° - 030°).
Wind component = cos 60° = 0.5 * 100 =50 kts headwind
GS = TAS - HW => 350 - 50 = 300 kts
Distance = Speed * Time
100 = 300 * t => 0.33 h * 60 =20 minutes
Closest answer is 21 minutes.

A. B
15 minutes

Refer to figure.
Calculate the fuel required to an alternate located 80 NM away at an approximate landing weight of 50000 kg and a headwind of 20 knots.

Images:
- images/AT00134_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
According to the first table "Ground to Air Miles Conversion" for a 20 kt headwind:
If the ground distance = 50 NM, the air distance = 55 NM;
If the ground distance = 100 NM, the air distance = 108 NM.
To find the air distance corresponding to 80 NM ground distance we must interpolate:
From the ground distance of 50 NM to 100 NM, the air distance increases by 53 NM (108 - 55);
Therefore, when the ground distance increases by 30 NM (50 NM to 80 NM), the air distance will increase by:

NAM = (30 x 53) / 50 NM = 32 NM
An Ground Distance of 80 NM corresponds to an Air Distance of: 55 NM + 32 NM = 87 NM
According to the second table "Trip Fuel and Time Required":
If the air distance = 50 NM and landing weight = 50 000 kg => fuel required equals 600 kg;
If the air distance = 100 NM, and landing weight = 50 000 kg => fuel required equals 900 kg;
To find the fuel required corresponding to 87 NM air distance we must interpolate:
From the air distance of 50 NM to 100 NM, the fuel required increases by 300 kg;
Therefore, when the air distance increases by 37 NM (50 NM to 87 NM), the fuel required will increase by:

Fuel required = (300 x 37) / 50 = 222 kg
The Fuel required to the alternate (air distance of 87 NM) equals = 600 kg + 222 kg = 822 kg

The navigation plan reads:
Trip fuel: 100 kg
Flight time: 1 h 35 min
Taxi fuel: 3 kg
Block fuel: 181 kg
The endurance on the ICAO flight plan should read:

Explanation:
ITEM 19 - Endurance
After E/ INSERT a 4-figure group giving the fuel endurance in hours and minutes.
Fuel Endurance in Item 19 of ATC Flight Plan is for Search Radius, in case an Aircraft is reported missing or overdue. It must be the Total Fuel Endurance of the Aircraft, and must take into account the Total Fuel On-Board - it is the time the aircraft can remain airborne, and, therefore, includes all usable fuel onboard (including any reserves). However, it does not include taxi fuel.
Calculate the Fuel Flow:
Fuel Flow = Trip Fuel / Flight Time
Fuel Flow = 100 kg / 1h 35 min = 63.16 kg/h
Calculate Total Fuel onboard at take off (excluding Taxi Fuel):
Take-Off Fuel = Block Fuel - Taxi Fuel = 181 kg - 3 kg = 178 kg
Calculate Endurance:
Endurance = Take-Off Fuel / Fuel Flow = 178 kg : 63.16 kg/h = 2 h 49 min

Options:
A. A
2 h 04 min

The legend for a chart states that the procedure is an APV Baro or APV SBAS instrument approach procedure. The significance of this is that the approach is an approach procedure with vertical guidance, which is....

Explanation:
RNP approaches with vertical guidance are known as APV approaches. APV approaches can be one of two types, distinguished by how the vertical guidance is provided. Lateral guidance is always GNSS.
Vertical guidance will either be based on barometric data - in APV baro, Baro VNAV or LNAV/VNAV approaches, or a geometric path created using GNSS signals and the Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) for the region of operation - APV SBAS or LPV approaches.
These approaches include a virtual glidepath and comparison of the aircraft's vertical position with that virtual glidepath, As such, they are "3D" operations.
LNAV/VNAV is a 3D approach with Barometric vertical guidance (APV Baro).
LPV is a 3D approach with vertical guidance (APV), like a conventional ILS, but using GNSS augmented by SBAS.

Consider the following NOTAM. When within the reduced range, what service might NOT be available from Kirkwall during the validity period?
Q EGPX/QCAAS/IV/B/AE/000/021/5857N00254W002
A EGPA
B FROM: 15/12/30 17:29
C TO: 16/01/31 19:45
E KIRKWALL MAIN VHF TRANSMITTER 118.3 MHZ WITHDRAWN FROM SERVICE DUE FAULT. STANDBY TRANSMITTER IN USE WITH REDUCED RANGE AND COVERAGE.

Explanation:
The answer is VDF and not ATC clearance even though the frequency falls in the VHF Communication range, the NOTAM would mention an alternate frequency if the voice channel transmitter was not available.
VHF Direction Finding VDF
VDF provides a means of determining the aircraft bearing from a ground station. VDF stations are capable of measuring the direction of arrival of radio transmissions from aircraft. In earlier days, such a service operated in MF, HF, and VHF bands. Today, the service (for civil aviation) operates on frequencies from 118 to 137 MHz in the VHF band. These frequencies are identical with the working frequencies of the aircraft communication radio.
If the communications transmitter on an aircraft is tuned to the VDF frequency and the transmitter is activated, the aerials at the VDF unit will detect the incoming transmission and each aerial element will feed a signal to the VDF receiver. Since the aerial elements will all be at slightly different distances from the source of the signal, each will detect a slightly different phase of that signal at the same instant.
On some VDF units a simple digital read out gives the bearing. A ground DF station can give true or magnetic bearings. It is common to use the so-called «Q-codes»:
QTE True bearing from the station
QDR Magnetic bearing from the station
QDM Magnetic bearing to the station
QTF Position of a station taken by bearings from D/F stations
QUJ True bearing to the station
In practice, only QDM and QDR are normally used. The accuracy of the bearing is measured in degrees. Bearings are categorised, in accordance with the ICAO defined classifications, as given in the following list:
Class A accurate within ± 2°
Class B accurate within ± 5°
Class C accurate within ± l0°
Class D accuracy less than Class C
Due to topography, some VDF stations are approved for use within certain sectors only. In that case, specific information for that aerodrome will be given in AIP. Stations that are listed in the AIP provide a ‘homing’ service. Generally the class of bearing is no worse than class B. (Many states will not permit Class C & D bearings to be provided). Ground DF stations should not be used as en-route navigation aids.

Refer to AMSTERDAM (EHAM) SID Chart 10-3J from the Jeppesen GSPRM2017.
What is the Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA)?

Images:
- images/AT00139_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA) is the lowest altitude in feet which provides a minimum vertical clearance of 1000 ft above all obstacles in an area contained within a circle of 25 NM radius centred on a ground navigational aid. MSA may be given as one value or could be divided into sub-sectors, each sector having a different value.
On a Jeppesen SID chart, MSA is depicted in maroon colour.
On the AMSTERDAM (EHAM) SID 10-3J chart, the MSA is divided into two sub-sectors by two magnetic bearings to the station (QDM) VOR/DME SPL: 357o and 310o.
If subtracted by 180o, the two bearings to the station VOR/DME SPL will be converted into Radials (QDR) and they become correspondingly:
357o - 180o = 177o
310o - 180o = 130o
The MSA as an altitude is always expressed in feet.
Therefore, the MSA is 1700 ft between the radials 177o and 130o from VOR/DME SPL.

Determine the distance of the PET from the departure point, given:
Distance from departure to destination: 285 NM
True Track: 348
W/V: 280/25
TAS :128 kt

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
We have wind information and True Airspeed (TAS), and we need to compute Groundspeed (GS).
To calculate the GS using the Flight computer (step by step) – please refer to the attached figure:
Set the wind direction beneath the True Index – let's set it at 280º.
Mark the wind speed above the centre point – for instance, place the dot over the TAS (128 kt) and mark the wind speed above it (+25), resulting in 153.
Set the True course beneath the True Index - GS out at 348º and GS home at 168º.
Slide the wind speed mark to align with the True Airspeed of 128 kt.
You can then read the Groundspeed (GS) in the centre circle, which is 136 kt for GS home and 117 kt for GS out.
We can now apply the formula:
Distance to PET = (GS home x Distance) / (GS out + GS home)
Distance to PET = (136 x 285) / (136 + 117)
Distance to PET = 153 NM

Question Number: AT00143
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft on a track of 046º(M) has to fly over an obstacle of 4600 ft with a clearance of 1000 ft. The QNH is 990 hPa and the temperature is ISA -15°C. What is the minimum safe flight level at which the aircraft may fly?
Assume 30ft per hPa.

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 5 600 ft (4 600 ft + 1 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (5 600/1 000) = 336 ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 5 936 ft.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 690 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 5 936 ft + 690 ft = 6 626 ft.
According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290:
For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)
For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)
The aircraft flies a north-easterly magnetic track of 046º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL70.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

THEN

Refer to ALICANTE (LEAL) STAR chart 10-2B from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
An aircraft following the VLC 2N STAR procedure performs an emergency descent, due to cabin depressurization, 20 NM before reaching at BESOR IAF. What is the minimum permitted altitude or FL along the STAR procedure which provides the required obstacle and terrain clearance immediately after the beginning of the emergency descent?

Images:
- images/AT00144_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The chart 10-2B depicts four STAR procedures: CALLES 1L (CLS1L), CALLES 2N (CLS2N), VALENCIA 2L (VLC2L) and VALENCIA 2N (VLC2N) for Rwy 10/28 of the Alicante airport.
The VLC2N STAR procedure starts from the VLC VOR/DME and ends at BESOR Initial Approach Fix (IAF), after which an approach procedure will commence.
When performing an emergency descent, without delay, the pilots must descend to the lowest safe altitude or 10 000 ft, whichever is higher.
The Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA) is the lowest altitude which may be used which will provide a minimum clearance of 300 m (1 000 ft) above all objects located in the area contained within a sector of a circle of 46 km (25 NM) radius centred on a radio aid to navigation.
The highest obstacle along VLC2N is 5 110 ft high, outside the MSA and it is above 5 000 ft, so we need 2 000 ft clearance. Therefore the minimum altitude the aircraft may descend to is 7 110 ft.

         (1) MORA is a minimum flight altitude computed by Jeppesen from current operational navigation charts (ONCs) or world aeronautical charts (WACs). Two types of MORAs are                charted which are:
(i) route MORAs e.g. 9800a; and
(ii) grid MORAs e.g. 98.
(2) Route MORA values are computed on the basis of an area extending 10 NM to either side of route centreline and including a 10 NM radius beyond the radio fix/reporting point or mileage break defining the route segment.
(3) MORA values clear all terrain and man-made obstacles by 1 000 ft in areas where the highest terrain elevation or obstacles are up to 5 000 ft. A clearance of 2 000 ft is provided above all terrain or obstacles that are 5 001 ft and above.
(4) A grid MORA is an altitude computed by Jeppesen and the values are shown within each grid formed by charted lines of latitude and longitude. Figures are shown in thousands and hundreds of feet (omitting the last two digits so as to avoid chart congestion). Values followed by ± are believed not to exceed the altitudes shown.

Refer to figure.
An extract from a typical flight plan produced by an airline flight planning tool. The remaining fuel overhead KOGAS is 5210 kg. Assume that the fuel flow remains the same as experienced between OKEPI and KOGAS and that the actual times between the waypoints are as planned. What is the estimated remaining fuel overhead TOD?

Images:
- images/AT00148_img_1.png

Explanation:
For this question, the remaining fuel overhead KOGAS is 5210 kg, the fuel flow can be found using the data from OKEPI to KOGAS:
The planned flight time from OKEPI to KOGAS is: 01 + 02 + 02 + 06 + 04 + 05 = 20 min and it burns: 5990 kg - 5210 kg = 780 kg.
Thus, the aircraft's fuel flow → burns 780 kg for 20 min, burns X for 1 min → X = 39 kg/min
The flight time from KOGAS to TOD is: 07 + 02 + 23 + 17 + 3 = 52 min. So, the fuel required from KOGAS to TOD will be: 52 min x 39 kg/min = 2028 kg.

Question Number: AT00149
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

The maximum fuel capacity of an aircraft is 1 400 lb, and the pilot has to order fuel to fill up en route to the final destination. The pilot estimates landing at the fuelling point with 350 lb on board. How many 40 Imperial gallon fuel drums must be ordered if the fuel supplier states a specific gravity of 0.78?

Explanation:
The pilot estimates that the aircraft will be landing at the en route refuelling point with 350 lb on board.
Thus, it will have burnt: 1 400 lb - 350 lb = 1 050 lbs or (1 050/2.2 = 477.3 kg).
Also, 1 IG = 4.55 litres. So, the 40 IG fuel drums in litres are: 40 IG x 4.55 lt = 182 litres fuel drums.
With Specific Gravity 0.78 kg/lt, each 182 litres fuel drum will weigh: 0.78 kg/lt x 182 lt = 142 kg.
The aircraft must be refuelled with 477.3 kg at en route refuelling point using 142 kg fuel drums, then: 477.3 kg / 142 kg = 3.4 fuel drums will be required.
But, the fuel drums cannot be in decimal form. Thus, the fuel drums must be at least 4 to cover the minimum refuelling requirement of 477.3 kg.

Refer to figure.
During a flight, a fault message appears stating that the valves allowing fuel to be transferred from the left outer wing tank to the left inner wing tank are stuck in the closed position. These valves can NOT be opened manually. Given the following information, determine the fuel available for the remainder of the flight.
Left and right inner tanks: 3000 kg each
Left and right outer tanks: full
Centre tank: empty
All other technical aspects of the fuel system operate normally.
Do NOT consider fuel imbalance restrictions for this scenario.

Images:
- images/AT00152_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
There are two electrical transfer valves connecting each outer wing tank to its associated inner wing tank. According to the fault message, the fuel from the left outer wing tank cannot be transfered to the left inner tank due to the left valve malfunction, thus it cannot be used.
So, the fuel available for the remainder of the flight will be:
Fuel available from the inner wing tanks: 2 x 3 000 kg = 6 000 kg.
Fuel available only from the right outer wing tank: 691 kg.
Therefore, totally, the remaining fuel availbale is: 6 000 kg + 691 kg = 6 691 kg.

Images:
- images/AT00160_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The correct answer for this question has not been verified. Please let us know if you come across this question in your exam. Thank you!
Basic Area Navigation (B-RNAV) or RNAV 5 (in Europe) was introduced to enable en-route capacity gains to be achieved with minimal aircraft capability. B-RNAV is defined as RNAV that meets a track keeping accuracy equal to or better than +/-5 NM for 95% of the flight time. This value includes signal source error, airborne receiver error, display system error, and flight technical error.
BRNAV can be achieved using inputs from:
DME/DME,
VOR/DME,
INS or IRS and
GPS.
The GERVU 1M requires B-RNAV equipment and it represents an RNAV overlay, and the waypoints can still be navigated with ground aids reference (BRNAV).
Note: If GERVU 1M was exclusively RNAV, it would be explicitly labeled as "RNAV," and there would be no radials or distances specified for the RNAV waypoints.

When reviewing the wind charts in the briefing room, you notice that the average wind in cruise will be 25 kt tailwind. Given the following data, what will be the flight time to destination?
Time to top of climb: 28 minutes
Cruise leg: 760 NM, FL 330 TAS 470 kt ISA -10°C
Time from top of descent to landing: 20 minutes

Explanation:
An essential part of the flight planning is knowledge of the weather conditions you will encounter. So, you need to understand the weather conditions en-route, at departure and destination airfields.
For this question:
Firstly, calculate the cruise Grounspeed at FL330: Cruise Groundspeed = Cruise TAS + average tailwind = 470 kt + 25 kt = 495 kt.
Calculate the cruise time from Top of Climb to Top of Descent: Cruise time = Cruise leg / Cruise Groundspeed = 1.53 hr or 1 hr 32 min.
Therefore, the total flight time to destination is: Time to TOC + Cruise time + Time from TOD to destination = 28 min + 1hr 32 min + 20 = 2 hr 20 min.

Options:
A. A
2 hours 25 minutes

Images:
- images/AT00165_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA) is printed on the instrument approach charts. It identifies the minimum altitude that provides a 1 000 ft vertical clearance above obstacles within 25 NM of the navigational facility. It may be given as one value or could be divided into sectors, each sector having a different value. The MSA is for emergency use only.
On the approach charts, the MSA is depicted at the top right corner.
For this approach chart, the MSA between the inbound magnetic bearings 245º and 345º, or between Radial 065º and Radial 165º correspondingly, is 4 200 ft within 25 NM.
Since the aircraft is approaching from Radial 085° (between R065º and R165º) and is 14 NM away from the VOR station, then the MSA is 4 200 ft.

Question Number: AT00170
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Given the following information for a Commercial Air Transport flight, what is the time (in minutes) needed from the destination to the alternate aerodrome? Assume an operation with a Performance Class A aeroplane applying the Basic Fuel Scheme or with a helicopter (the basic fuel planning provisions are the same).
Missed approach at the destination: 6 minutes
Climb to cruise level: 7 minutes
Cruise distance: 130 NM
Cruise TAS: 145 kt
Wind component: 10 kt tailwind
Anticipated hold at the alternate: 11 minutes
Descent to the alternate: 7 minutes
Approach to the alternate: 8 minutes

Explanation:
(1) Calculate Cruise Ground Speed:
Cruise TAS = 145 kt
Wind Component = 10 kt Tailwind
GS = 155 kt
(2) Calculate Cruise Time:
Cruise Distance = 130 NM
GS = 155 kt
Cruise Time = 130 NM / 155 kt = 50 min
(3) Calculate time from DESTINATION to ALTERNATE:
Missed approach at the destination + Climb to cruise level + Cruise Time + Anticipated hold at the alternate + Descent to the alternate + Approach to the alternate = 6 min + 7 min + 50 min + 11 + 7 min + 8 min = 89 min
NOTE:
Anticipated holding fuel should be taken into account - Any anticipated condition including holding should be in the minimum fuel. According to EASA, fuel for descent must take into account the expected arrival procedure.

The commander of a commercial air transport flight has been scheduled for the same flight in three consecutive days. During the first two flights he/she notices that the actual payload is higher than anticipated, having as a consequence increased fuel consumption to the destination aerodrome. If during the pre-flight fuel calculation for the third day, the commander decides to anticipate a similar event by adding 500 kg of fuel, this should be added as part of the....

Explanation:
Discretionary fuel (formerly: extra fuel) is “fuel at the sole discretion of the commander”, and its purpose is to account for any unplanned increase in fuel consumption caused by factors other than the ones for contingency fuel. The Commander's discretion is independent and not to be encouraged or discouraged.
Note: In the new EASA AIR OPS regulations, the fuel added at the commander’s discretion is referred to as “discretionary fuel.” On the other hand, “extra fuel” is the dispatch fuel quantity that must be carried, even if it means offloading some cargo, and is intended for anticipated delays or specific operational constraints.

Options:
A. A
additional fuel.
B. B
contingency fuel.
C. D
trip fuel.
D. C
discretionary fuel (formerly: extra fuel). ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00175
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft on a track of 240°(M) has to overfly an obstacle of 26 500 ft with a clearance of 2000 ft. The QNH is 1013 hPa and OAT is ISA + 10°C. What is the minimum Flight Level (FL) at which the aircraft may fly in RVSM airspace?
Assume 1 hPa = 30 ft

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (28 500/1000) = 1140ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules above (refer to the table above), to give an indicated altitude of ­­27 360 ft.
There is no need to calculate the pressure correction. The standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa does not require any pressure correction.

According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule:
For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)
For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)
The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 240°(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level in RVSM airspace, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL300.
Note: RVSM airspace - FL290 to FL410.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.
Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.
True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.

Refer to figure or to Amsterdam Chart 10-3C from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
An aircraft is cleared for the ANDIK2E SID to an altitude of 6000 ft and is then is re-authorized to climb to FL330. You are climbing with an average TAS of 381 kts and a 30 kt tailwind. The climb is 103 NAM (Nautical Air Miles). What is the total distance covered after waypoint ANDIK until top-of-climb?

Images:
- images/AT00176_img_1.png

Explanation:
Note: This question is similar to 334796, which asks about the ANDIK 2F SID, and has a 20 kt tailwind.
Refer to figure.
Given the NAM for the climb, we must calculate the NGM to cover given our TAS and tailwind. Our GS will be 381 + 30 = 411 kt. Recalling the equation and re-arranging it:
NGM / NAM = GS / TAS
NGM = NAM x (GS / TAS)
We can calculate that:
NGM = 103 x (411/381) = 111.1 NGM
Now referring to the chart, we follow the ANDIK 2E SID and add up the ground distance until reaching ANDIK. We see this gives us: 7 + 6 + 5.2 + 20 = 38.2 NGM.
After ANDIK, we still need to climb the remaining: 111.1 - 38.2 = 72.9 NGM or 73 NGM.

During the pre-flight briefing process, the Pilot-in-Command of a Commercial Air Transport flight notices that a thunderstorm activity is predicted along the planned route, which may cause deviations of more than 50 NM from the route. To determine the minimum ramp fuel, what should the Pilot-in-Command do, provided that the above deviation will increase the distance to be flown?

Explanation:
Minor deviations due to unforeseen circumstances are covered by Contingency Fuel. However, if a deviation is anticipated during pre-flight planning, the Pilot-in-Command should add an appropriate amount of Discretionary Fuel (formerly known as Extra Fuel), if necessary.
The final fuel decision rests with the Captain. If the Captain expects marginal weather conditions or potential air traffic delays, they may choose to load discretionary fuel. This decision is primarily based on experience and is often closely monitored by the Operator, as it impacts operational costs.

Refer to figure.
A pilot flying a VFR route is forced by weather to descend at Chiemsee Island from the planned cruising altitude of FL85 to FL45. The OAT at FL45 is +9ºC, the cruising CAS at that level is 130 kt, and the wind is as forecast. If the pilot flies the correct heading to account for the wind, to the nearest minute, what is the new ETA at Seeshaupt?

Images:
- images/AT00179_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
Using your Flight/Nav computer, find the TAS at FL45:
In the Airspeed correction window, align FL45 with OAT +9oC.
Opposite CAS 130 kt (13), read TAS 139 kt.
Using again your Flight/Nav computer, find the GS: TAS 139 kt, W/V 300/25, Track 267° from the flight plan/log:
Place the centre dot over TAS 139 kt.
Rotate the disk until wind direction 300o is under the True index.
Mark wind velocity 25 kt below the centre dot.
Rotate the disc until the course 267o is under the True index.
The mark shows a Groundspeed 119 kt.
Thus, the distance from Chiemsee Island to Seeshaupt at FL45 will be covered in: Sector distance / GS = 45 NM / 119 kt = 0.37 hr or 23 min.
Therefore, the new ETA at Seeshaupt at FL45 will be: 08:36 (ATA at Chiemsee) + 23 min (Sector time Chiemsee to Seeshaupt) = 08:59.

Question Number: AT00180
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

The minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) value to be applied in the primary area of a mountainous area during the en-route phase of an IFR flight is:

Explanation:
Minimum obstacle clearance altitude (MOCA) is the minimum altitude for a defined segment that provides the required MOC.
A MOCA is determined and published for each segment of the route. The MOCA provides the required clearance above obstacles contained inside the obstacle clearance areas. Charting accuracies are taken into account when establishing minimum altitudes by adding both a vertical and a horizontal tolerance to the depicted objects on the chart.
According to ICAO Doc 8168, PANS-OPS, Part I, Section 3 - Enroute Procedures - OBSTACLE CLEARANCE:
The minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) value to be applied in the primary area for the en-route phase of an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight is 300 m (1 000 ft).
In mountainous areas, this shall be increased depending on the variation in terrain elevation as follows:
Variation in Terrain Elevation MOC
3000 ft - 5000 ft (900 m - 1500 m) 1500 ft (450 m)
Greater than 5000 ft (1500 m) 2000 ft (600 m)

The MOC to be applied outside the primary area is normally equal to half the value of that applied in the primary area. Where this is found to be too constraining an alternative method is to use a value which reduces from the full MOC at the edge of the primary area to zero at the outer edge of the secondary area.

Options:
A. B
Always 2 000 ft.
B. C
If variation in terrain elevation is less than 5 000 ft: 2 000 ft, if variation is greater than 5 000 ft: 1 500 ft.

Refer to figure.
You are cruising at FL380 with a twin-engined jet aeroplane. However, due to turbulence, you descend from FL380 to FL360. Determine the fuel consumed at FL360 until the top of descent (TOD). The distance travelled at FL360 is 295 NM, the TAT is -17ºC and the aeroplane mass is 65 000 kg.

Images:
- images/AT00181_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
To begin, we will determine the fuel consumption for both engines during the flight at FL360 and a Total Air Temperature (TAT) of -17°C, using the provided table. Given an aircraft mass of 65 000 kg, please consult the relevant section of the attached table:
36 000 ft (-32ºC) FF/ENG (kg/h)
1 163
The FF/ENG value provided is not the final figure. Please direct your attention to the accompanying note situated in the table:
"Increase/decrease fuel flow by 3% per 10°C above/below standard TAT."
Based on the given information, the TAT at FL360 is -17°C, which is 15°C higher than the standard TAT of -32°C.
Consequently, the final FF/ENG is calculated as follows:
Final FF/ENG = 1 163 kg/h + 4.5% of 1 163 kg/h = 1 215.335 kg/h
The aircraft has two engines, therefore the total fuel flow is: 2 x 1 215.335 kg/h = 2 430.67 kg/h
Once more, we will make use of the attached table to establish the True Airspeed (TAS) at FL360. Kindly consult the relevant section of the attached table:
36 000 ft (-32ºC) TAS (kt)
450
This, however, is not the final TAS value for the particular flight. Please refer to the accompanying note positioned above the table:
"Increase/decrease TAS by 1 knot for every 1°C above/below standard TAT."
According to the information provided, the TAT at FL360 is -17°C, which is 15°C higher than the standard TAT. Consequently, the final TAS is calculated as follows:
Final TAS = 450 kt + 15 kt = 465 kt
At a speed of 465 kt, the duration needed to cover a distance of 295 NM can be calculated as follows:
Time = Distance/Speed = (295 NM)/(465 kt) = 0.6344 hours
Therefore, with a fuel flow rate of 2 430.67 kg/h, we can determine the anticipated fuel consumption for the flight at FL360:
Fuel consumption = (0.6344) x (2 430.67 kg/h) = 1 542 kg

Refer to figure.
Given the following information, calculate the time and distance from take-off to Top of Climb:
Aerodrome pressure altitude: 4000 ft
Aerodrome OAT: +8°C
Cruise pressure altitude: 10000 ft
Cruise OAT: -6°C

Images:
- images/AT00183_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The Figure 3.1 in CAP 697(Section 3, p. 3) is a graph showing the climb data for the MEP aeroplane. The three curves on the right hand side of the graph represent the FUEL, TIME and AIR DISTANCE values for climbing, for specific conditions (TOM 4750 lb, Climb speed 120 kt IAS, etc.). To calculate the fuel, time and distance from take-off to Top of Climb, follow the procedure below:
Enter the graph on the left side base scale at the aerodrome OAT +8°C and travel vertically up to intersect the aerodrome Pressure Altitude 4000 ft grid-line.
From this grid-line move horizontally right to intersect the fuel, time and distance grid-lines in turn.
From each intersection drop vertically to read the appropriate value from the graph:
FUEL = 3.8 USG
TIME = 7 min
AIR DISTANCE = 11 NAM
Repeat the above three steps, but with the ToC OAT and PA:
Enter the graph on the left side base scale at the ambient temperature at the top of climb OAT: -6°C and travel vertically up to intersect the top of climb Pressure Altitude 10000 ft grid-line.
From this grid-line move horizontally right to intersect the fuel, time and distance grid-lines in turn.
From each intersection drop vertically to read the appropriate value from the graph:
FUEL = 8.5 USG
TIME = 16 min
AIR DISTANCE = 28 NAM
Finally, subtract the values determined at aerodrome pressure altitude from those determined at TOC, to obtain the values of the fuel used to climb, the time taken to climb, and the air distance travelled in the climb:
FUEL from T/O to ToC = 8.5 - 3.8 = 4.7 USG
TIME from T/O to ToC = 16 - 7 = 9 min
AIR DISTANCE from T/O to ToC = 28 - 11 = 17 NAM

Refer to figure or STUTTGART (EDDS) chart 11-1 from Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
A pilot is under radar vectors in order to position for an ILS approach to runway 07. ATC clears the aircraft to descend to 4 000 ft on a heading of 105º to establish on and follow the ILS. Suddenly a complete electrical failure occurs and all navigation instruments are lost except for the standby compass. If the aircraft is in cloud, what is a safe altitude for the pilot to maintain while trying to restore the navigation instruments?

Images:
- images/AT00184_img_1.png

Explanation:
The Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA) is printed on the instrument approach charts. It identifies the minimum altitude that provides a 1 000 ft vertical clearance above obstacles within 25 NM of the navigational facility.
It may be given as one value or could be divided into sectors, each sector having a different value. The MSA is for emergency use only and on the approach charts the MSA is depicted at the top right corner.
In this scenario, where both the necessary navigation equipment for the ILS procedure and visibility are lost, the pilot's first action should be to assure terrain clearance by climbing at the highest MSA 4 600 ft.
By descending to the MSA of the sector, the pilot may not assure obstacle clearance, because he/she cannot be sure for the sector he/she is flying within after losing both the navigation equipment and visibility.

Options:
A. A
3 300 ft as the aircraft is probably within 15 NM of STG VOR.
B. B
4 000 ft as this is the platform altitude for the ILS approach.
C. D
1 467 ft as this is the minima for the CAT I ILS being flown.

Final Reserve Fuel is a quantity of fuel that should never be used, but is carried in order to provide a final safety net. You should always land with Final Reserve Fuel intact in the tanks.
According to the OPS 1.375 "In-flight fuel management":
The flight must be conducted so that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is not less than:
(i) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel, or
(ii) the final reserve fuel, if no alternate aerodrome is required.
Thus, the remaining fuel upon landing at the alternate aerodrome, since the alternate fuel will have been burnt to fly from the destination to the alternate aerodrome, will NOT less than the final reserve fuel.

Options:
A. A
fuel required for a go-around and subsequent visual landing.
B. B
fuel required to fly for 15 minutes at holding speed.
C. C
fuel required to fly for 45 minutes at cruise speed.
D. D
final reserve fuel. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00187
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to figure.
A Medium-Range Jet Aircraft is planned to perform a Commercial Air Transport flight to Sal International Airport, Cabo Verde (GVAC). For operational purposes, the Tenerife South International Airport (GCTS) is the nominated destination alternate, but for facilitation reasons, the commercial flight must follow the isolated aerodrome procedure requirements. Using the data below and the figures in the annex, calculate the required Additional Fuel (ADDFU) for the destination and destination alternate.
Average trip fuel flow: 2849 kg/h
Holding fuel flow: 2400 kg/h

Images:
- images/AT00187_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
According to AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.150(b)-Fuel policy-PLANNING CRITERIA-AEROPLANES:
(c) Predetermined point (PDP) procedure:
If the operator’s fuel policy includes planning to a destination alternate aerodrome where the distance between the destination aerodrome and the destination alternate aerodrome is such that a flight can only be routed via a predetermined point to one of these aerodromes, the amount of usable fuel, on board for departure, should be the greater of (c)(1) or (c)(2):
(1) The sum of:
(i) taxi fuel;
(ii) trip fuel from the departure aerodrome to the destination aerodrome, via the predetermined point;
(iii) contingency fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(3);
(iv) additional fuel if required, but not less than:
(A) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes plus 15 % of the flight time planned to be spent at cruising level or 2 hours, whichever is less; or
(B) for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for 2 hours at normal cruise consumption above the destination aerodrome, this should not be less than final reserve fuel; and
(v) extra fuel if required by the commander.
(2) The sum of:
(i) taxi fuel;
(ii) trip fuel from the departure aerodrome to the destination alternate aerodrome, via the predetermined point;
(iii) contingency fuel calculated in accordance with (a)(3);
(iv) additional fuel if required, but not less than:
(A) for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines: fuel to fly for 45 minutes; or
(B) for aeroplanes with turbine engines: fuel to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m) above the destination alternate aerodrome elevation in standard conditions, this should not be less than final reserve fuel; and
(v) extra fuel if required by the commander.
(d) Isolated aerodrome procedure:
If the operator’s fuel policy includes planning to an isolated aerodrome, the last possible point of diversion to any available en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome should be used as the Pre-Determined Point.
Thus, applying the above rule and using the data given by the annex, we get:
PDP-1 (Dep - PDP - GVAC): Taxi 200 kg + Trip fuel 16 239 kg + Contingency fuel 487 kg + Additional fuel 5 698 kg (2 hours at cruise fuel flow 2849 Kg/h) = 22 624 kg
PDP-2 (Dep - PDP - GCTS): Taxi 200 kg + Trip fuel 20 825 kg + Contingency fuel 625 kg + Additional fuel 1 200 kg (same as final reserve 30 min with holding fuel flow 2400 Kg/h) = 22 850 kg.
PDP-2 is the greater fuel amount, thus the Additional Fuel is 1 200 kg.

Refer to figure.
(For this question use the chart "E(LO) 5 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017). A route connects the waypoint AMGAR (42°33'18.40"N, 003°15'12.00"W) with TABANERA VOR (42°01'39.00"N, 004°06'33.00"W). What kind of route is this?

Images:
- images/AT00188_img_1.png

Explanation:
ATS route is a specified route designed for channelling the flow of traffic as necessary for the provision of air traffic services. The term ATS route is used to mean variously airway, advisory route, controlled or uncontrolled etc.
Area navigation (RNAV) is a method of navigation which permits aircraft operation on any desired flight path within the coverage of ground or space - based navigation aids or within the limits of capability of self-contained aids, or a combination of these.
The waypoint AMGAR and TABANERA VOR are along an ATS route, W71. Along this ATS route RNAV (Area navigation) method can be used within the coverage of BUR VOR/DME.
Therefore, the section of the ATS route W71, which connects AMGAR and TABANERA, is an RNAV ATS route and is followed by the supplementary letter "R", which stands for "an RNAV ATS route not identified by the Designator".

Options:
A. A
Direct ATS route.
B. C
Conditional ATS route.
C. D
ATS route used by non B-RNAV equipped aircraft.
D. B

Refer to figure.
If the fuel flow in the cruise was exactly as the crew expected when planning the flight, what is the expected fuel remaining for the fuel check overhead TORDU at 19:42? All Flight Log fuels are in kg.

Images:
- images/AT00189_img_1.png

Explanation:
Although the fuel flow has remained the same according to the question, the aircraft has a higher groundspeed:
Fuel flow = (Planned fuel remaining at ToC - Planned fuel remaining at TORDU) / Planned flight time from ToC to TORDU = [(360 kg - 241 kg) / 53] x 60 = 135 kg/hr.
The question asks the expected fuel remaining for the fuel check overhead TORDU at 19:42 (50 minutes after the TOC).
In 50 minutes to TORDU, with a fuel flow of 135 kg/h, the aircraft would have burnt 112.5 kg of fuel.
Looking at the Top-Of-Climb Planned Fuel Remaining column, the pilot initially planned to have 360 kg, but he/she actually had 375 kg, as it is recorded in the ToC Fuel Check column.
TORDU = 375 kg - 112.5 kg = 262.5 kg (263 kg)

Question Number: AT00190
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A mountain 6 011 ft AMSL will be crossed. What is the lowest VFR ICAO level the aircraft must fly to obtain a clearance of 2 000 ft? Given:
Variation: 10ºW
Aircraft's Track: 356º T
Aircraft's HDG: 355º M
QNH: 990 hPa
Assume 1 hPa = 30 ft

Explanation:
First considerations:
To obtain a terrain clearance of 2 000 ft, the aircraft must be flown at a true altitude of = 6 011 ft + 2 000 ft = 8 011 ft
When flying Flight Levels, the altimeter is set to Standard Pressure (1013 hPa).
Pressure Correction:
Note: If QNH is higher than 1013 hPa => True Altitude is higher than IA.
If QNH is lower than 1013 hPa => True Altitude is lower than IA.

Local pressure equals 990 hPa which is lower than standard pressure by 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa.
23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 690 ft
Indicated Altitude = True Altitude + Pressure Correction
Indicated Altitude = 8 011 ft + 690 ft = 8 701 ft
Semicircular Flight Rules:
IFR flight levels/altitudes are divisible by 1 000 ft (i.e. 7 000 ft, 8 000 ft, 9 000 ft). The VFR rules of flight level and/or altitude selection is the same as IFR ones with adding 500 ft to all levels.
The default worldwide semi-circular rule is the East/West orientation of the flight level parity:
Your aircraft has track between 0° and 179°, your flight level or altitude must be odd;
Your aircraft has track between 180° and 359°, your flight level or altitude must be even.
The appropriate altitude or flight level must be determined using the magnetic track (not heading).
In this case, True Track (TT) equals 356º, applying the magnetic Variation provided (10ºW), we can find the Magnetic Track (MT)
Variation West, magnetic direction BEST; Variation East, Magnetic Direction LEAST.
MT = 356º + 10º = 006º
According to the rules shared above, an ODD flight level + 500 ft must be used:
First available Flight level above 8 701 ft => FL95

A. A
FL090
B. C
FL115
C. D

Question Number: AT00191
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft is flying at FL80. The ISA deviation is -20ºC. The elevation of the ground is 2500ft and the QNH equals 1040 hPa. The True Altitude is:

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1040 hPa - 1013 hPa = 27 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 27 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­810 ft. This value needs to be added to the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude = 8 000 ft + 810 ft = 8 810 ft.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -20ºC. The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account: 8 810 ft - 2 500 ft = 6 310 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-20) × (6 310/1000) = - 505 ft.
The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 8 810 ft - 505 ft = 8 305 ft
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN

Question Number: AT00192
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft is following a route outside controlled airspace where the MOCA is 3300 ft and the transition altitude is 3000 ft. Given the following information, what is the minimum flight level for the aircraft in IFR?
Magnetic Track: 182°
Magnetic Variation: 8°W
Nearby Aerodrome Elevation: 27 ft
Nearby Aerodrome QNH: 991 hPa
Nearby Aerodrome Temperature: -7°C

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 3300 ft as this is the MOCA (Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature for a given flight level/altitude, in this case we have the temperature at the aerodrome, which is -7°C at an elevation of 27 ft amsl. As this is so close to sea level, we can say that the ISA temperature is 15ºC, and therefore the ISA deviation is ISA -22°C.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction for the minimum true altitude (3 300 ft). The ISA deviation is ISA -22°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (22) × (3300/1000) = 290.4 ft.
The temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below, to give an indicated altitude of 3 590.4 ft.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 991 hPa = 22 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = (22 hPa) x 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 3590.4 ft + (660 ft) = 4250.4 ft.
As flight levels are pressure altitudes, we can therefore say that the lowest usable flight level is the next usable flight level suitable for that magnetic track above 4250.4 ft, which is FL60, as per the semicircular rule.
The semicircular rule works based on the magnetic track of an aircraft, and for tracks of 000°-179°, IFR aircraft should fly at odd flight levels (FL70, FL90, etc.), and for tracks from 180°-359°, even flight levels (FL60, FL80, etc.)
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.

Given the following information, calculate the change in planned Trip Fuel with updated forecast meteorological conditions.
Trip distance: 150 NGM
Planned average trip TAS: 120 kt
Planned average Trip Fuel consumption: 3 kg/NAM
Change in OAT: 10° C higher
Change in wind component: increase from +5 kt to +10 kt
Effect on TAS: 2 kt increase for every 5° C increase in OAT
Effect on Trip Fuel: 0.5% increase for every 10° C increase in OAT
The change in planned Trip Fuel will be

Explanation:
For the PLANNED conditions:
(1) Convert NGM into NAM:
NAM = NGM x TAS/GS
GS = TAS + Tailwind = 120 kt + 5 kt = 125 kt
NAM = 150 NGM x 120 / 125 = 144 NAM
(2) Calculate fuel consumed:
Trip fuel consumption: 3 kg/NAM
144 NAM x 3 kg/NAM = 432 kg
For the UPDATED conditions:
(1) Convert NGM into NAM:
Note: Change in OAT will affect our TAS: "2 kt increase for every 5° C increase in OAT"
In our case, OAT: 10ºC Higher; Therefore, Actual TAS = TAS + 4 kt = 120 kt + 4 kt = 124 kt
GS = TAS + Tailwind = 124 kt + 10 kt = 134 kt
NAM = 150 NGM x 124 / 134 = 138.8 NAM
(2) Calculate fuel consumed:
Trip fuel consumption: 3 kg/NAM
138.8 NAM x 3 kg/NAM = 416.4 kg
(3) Correct fuel consumed for Change in OAT:
"Effect on Trip Fuel: 0.5% increase for every 10° C increase in OAT"
416.4 kg x 0.5% = 2.1 kg
416.4 kg + 2.1 kg = 418.5 kg
=> The change in planned Trip Fuel will be 432 kg - 418.5 kg = 13.5 kg less.

Options:
A. A
15.6 kg less.
B. B
15.6 kg more.

Refer to figure or to ALICANTE (LEAL) STAR 10-2B from Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
You are briefing the VLC2L STAR into LEAL, and your captain asks you for the MEA and the distance between Valencia VOR and your IAF. What do you reply?

Images:
- images/AT00200_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA) is the lowest published altitude (between radio fixes that meets obstacle clearance requirements between fixes.
The MEA applies to the entire width of the airway, segment or route between the defining radio fixes. In many countries the MEA is at such an altitude as to ensure acceptable radio navigational signal coverage.
The segment distance between Valencia (VLC) VOR/DME and the IAF (VILNA) waypoint is 59 NM, written midway along the route in Nautical Miles, below the distance the MEA FL80 is also written and further below it is confirmed that the route depicted is the STAR VALENCIA 2L (VLC2L).
The other number 66 nearby indicates the MORA (Minimum Off Route Altitude) for that section of the chart (grid MORA) is 6,600 ft, which only takes into account terrain clearance and no other items (such as radio aid reception or minimum procedure altitude), but for the whole area inside those grid lines. It is therefore different from the MEA.

Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

The temperature correction in a instrument approach must be applied when it is (1) _____ than ISA and correction is (2) _____ to/from the DH.

Explanation:
ICAO Doc 8168
4.3 TEMPERATURE CORRECTION
4.3.1 Requirement for temperature correction
The calculated minimum safe altitudes/heights must be adjusted when the ambient temperature on the surface is much lower than that predicted by the standard atmosphere. In such conditions, an approximate correction is 4 per cent height increase for every 10°C below standard temperature as measured at the altimeter setting source. This is safe for all altimeter setting source altitudes for temperatures above –15°C.
Even if the baromeric settings on the altimeter are correct, the true altitude will differ from the indicated altitude, if the temperature differs from the ISA values. The altimeter is calibrated to ISA. If the temperature differs from ISA, the QNH will only read the correct altitude on the ground. If you are airborne, you may need to apply a temperature correction to get the true altitude.
In warm conditions (higher than ISA), this is not dangerous, because the trues altitude will be higher than the indicated (safe error). However, in very cold air (lower than ISA), and close to the ground, the temperature error may be critical as the true altitude will be less than the indicated altitude (dangerous error).
An easy way to remember this is that, when the temperature is LOW, the aircraft will be LOWER than indicated.
There are also two mnemonics that may be used to remember these effects:
High - Low - High, which means that, if you fly from high to low, either pressure or temperature, your altimeter will read high.
Low - High - Low, which means that, if you fly from low to high, either pressure or temperature, your altimeter will read low.
And there is also an other one mnemonic to decide which effect requires attention:
High to Low - Careful Go: which implies that, if you are going from either high temperature or pressure to lower, then you are closer to the ground than you expect.
It is essential, therefore, to make an altimeter temperature error correction when calculating minimum descent heights in very cold conditions. The amount to add on to the indicated height or altitude to get the true value, is usually derived from correction tables.
Therefore, in very cold conditions (colder than ISA), a temperature correction must added to the decision height (DH), MDH or MDA.

Options:
A. A
(1) warmer; (2) subtracted.
B. B
(1) colder; (2) subtracted.
C. C
(1) warmer; (2) added.
D. D
(1) colder; (2) added. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00203
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft on a track of 240°(M) has to overfly an obstacle of 25 700 ft with a clearance of 2000 ft. The QNH is 1033 hPa and OAT is ISA + 20°C. What is the minimum flight level (FL) at which the aircraft may fly in RVSM airspace?
Assume 1 hPa = 30 ft

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 27 700 ft (25 700 ft + 2000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +20°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules above, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+20) × (27 700/1000) = 2216 ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­25 484 ft.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1033 hPa - 1013 hPa = 20 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 20 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 600 ft. This value needs to be subtracted to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:

Pressure Altitude = 25 484 ft - 600 ft = 24 884 ft.

According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule:
For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)
For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)
The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 240°(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL300.
Note: This question is trying to trick you. Do not forget that RVSM airspace is between FL290 to FL410.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.
Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.
True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.

Question Number: AT00204
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft flying a distance of 220 NM with a ground speed of 140 kt, after 40 minutes of flight a fuel amount of 46 kg is left in its tanks. If the planned fuel flow is 45 kg/h, what will be the difference between the planned and the actual fuel flow?

Explanation:
The Flight time for the total distance is: Distance / GS = 220 NM / 140 kt = 1.57 hr or 94 min.
The Planned consumption for the 1.57 hr Flight time is: Flight time x Planned fuel flow = 1.57 hr x 45 kg/hr = 71 kg.
46 kg of fuel is left on board after 40 minutes, thus the aircraft burnt: 71 kg - 46 kg = 25 kg in 40 minutes.
Therefore, the actual fuel flow is: 25 kg/40 min or 37 kg/hr.
Finally, the difference between the planned and the actual fuel flow is: Planned - Actual fuel flow = 45 kg/hr - 37 kg/hr = 8 kg/hr less than planned.

Options:
A. A
8 kg/hr more than planned
B. B
12 kg/hr more than planned
C. C
12 kg/hr less than planned
D. D
8 kg/hr less than planned ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00205
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A pilot is planning a flight from aerodrome A to aerodrome B using aerodrome C as alternate. The distance from A to B is 120 NM on a true track 090° and the distance from B to C is 60 NM on a true track 360°. If the planned TAS is 120 kt and the forecast wind 330°/25 kt, the planned flight time from A to B will be (1) _____ and from B to C will be (2) _____.

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
For this question using your Navigation/Flight computer, apply the following steps twice:
1. From A to B:
Set wind direction to 330º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 120 kt.
Mark the wind velocity 25 kt down from the centre point.
Initially, set the True Track to 090º under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
Note that this heading would result in 10ºR drift and a track of 100º.
Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 090º. This occurs at a heading of 080º with 10ºR drift.
The groundspeed for this track is approximately 130 kt.
Thus, the flight time from A to B is: 120 NM / 130 kt = 0.92 hr or 55 min.
2. From B to C:
Set wind direction to 330º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 120 kt.
Mark the wind velocity 25 kt down from the centre point.
Initially, set the True Track to 360º under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
Note that this heading would result in 8ºR drift and a track of 008º.
Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 360º. This occurs at a heading of 352º with 6ºR drift.
The groundspeed for this track is approximately 98 kt.
Thus, the flight time from A to B is: 60 NM / 98 kt = 0.61 hr or 37 min.

Question Number: AT00206
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

The highest obstacle located within 8 km of a specific IFR route is 1220 ft. What is the minimum altitude providing the required obstacle clearance?

Explanation:
When flying IFR en-route, inside or outside a controlled airspace, an aircraft must fly at a level which is at least 1 000 ft (300 m) above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft.
Whilst, when flying over high terrain or in mountainous areas, at a level which is at least 2 000 ft (600 m) above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aricraft.
Thus, if the highest obstacle located within 8 km of a specific IFR route is 1220 ft, then the minimum altitude providing the required obstacle clearance must be: 1 220 ft + 1 000 ft = 2 220 ft.
Note: According to ICAO Annex 2 Rules of the Air, Chapter 5;
5.1.2 Minimum levels
Except when necessary for take-off or landing, or except when specifically authorized by the appropriate authority, an IFR flight shall be flown at a level which is not below the minimum flight altitude established by the State whose territory is overflown, or, where no such minimum flight altitude has been established:
a) over high terrain or in mountainous areas, at a level which is at least 600 m (2 000 ft) above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft;
b) elsewhere than as specified in "a", at a level which is at least 300 m (1 000 ft) above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft.

Options:
A. B

Question Number: AT00207
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to VFR Chart ED-4 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
You are flying over Haigerloch (N48°22′, E008°48′) at FL95 and would like to cross over reporting point Lima (N48°37', E009°9') at 3500 ft. Given the following information, what should your rate of descent be?
Wind at FL95: 270°/35 kt
Wind at 3500 ft: 240°/15 kt
TAS: 146 kt

Images:
- images/AT00207_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
To calculate the rate of descent needed from Haigerloch to reporting point Lima, we must first find how many minutes it takes us to travel between those points and to do that we must find the track, distance and use the wind to calculate the ground speed.
To find the true track, draw a line between the 2 points and measure the true track at the meridian between both locations (042°).
The distance between the two points is 20 NM. This can be found out by measuring the distance between the two points on the chart and then comparing the distance with the scale on the side of the chart, or using the meridians, since 1° of latitude equals 60 NM at all latitudes.
W/V used for climb problems is the W/V at the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude.
W/V used for descent problems is the W/V at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude.
Since the wind is 270°/35kt at FL95 and 240°/15kt at 3500 ft and we are descending, we must take the wind at 1/2 of the descent altitude. At FL65, exactly in between FL95 and 3500 ft (assuming QNH 1013), the wind will be exactly in between the 2 values. The wind at FL65 is 255°/25kt.
Now we must calculate the groundspeed using the wind:
TAS: 146 kt; W/V: 255/25; True Track: 042°
Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing W/V, TAS and required track.
Set wind direction to 255° under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 146 kt.
Mark the wind velocity 25 kt down from the centre point.
Initially, set the True Track to 042° under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
Note that this heading would result in 5°R drift and a track of 047°.
Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 042°. This occurs at a heading of 037° with 5°R drift.
The groundspeed for this track is approximately 166 kt.
Since the distance between Haigerloch and reporting point Lima is 20 NM, we can calculate how many minutes it would take to travel between them:
20 NM / 166 kt = 0.12 hr = 7 mins
We can now finally calculate the ROD. The aircraft must descend 6000 ft from FL95 to 3500 ft (assuming QNH 1013). To descend 6000 ft in 7 mins, the aircraft must have a ROD of 6000 ft / 7 mins = 857 fpm.
The correct ROD is 860 fpm.

Given:
Planned and actual data as shown in the Flight Log excerpt. Provided that flight conditions on the leg GAMMA to DELTA remain unchanged and fuel consumption remains unchanged, what fuel remaining should be expected at waypoint DELTA?

Images:
- images/AT00209_img_1.png

Explanation:
First Step: Calculate the actual fuel consumption BETA - GAMMA
Fuel consumed BETA - GAMMA = Actual Fuel remaining at BETA - Actual Fuel Remaining at GAMMA
5270 kg – 5150 kg = 120 kg
Time BETA – GAMMA = 2:03 – 1:53 = 10 min
Fuel Consumption = 120 / 10 = 12 kg/min
Second Step: Calculate fuel consumed GAMMA - DELTA
Note: Provided that the flight conditions will not change, the ATA over DELTA will be equal to ETA => 2:53.
TIME GAMMA - DELTA = 2:53 - 2:03 = 50 min
Fuel consumed: 50 min x 12 kg/min = 600 kg
Third Step: Calculate Fuel remaining at DELTA
FUEL at DELTA = Actual Fuel over GAMMA - Fuel Consumed (GAMMA - DELTA)
FUEL at DELTA = 5150 kg – 600 kg = 4550 kg

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
A "fly-by waypoint" is one where the pilot is required to use turn anticipation to avoid overshooting and allow tangential interception of the next flight segment. In other words, "fly-by waypoints" are used when an aircraft should begin a turn to the next course prior to reaching the waypoint separating the two route segments.
A "fly-over waypoint" precludes any turn until the waypoint is overflown and is followed by an intercept maneuver of the next flight segment. In other words, "fly-over waypoints" are used when the aircraft must fly over the point prior to starting a turn. In this case, in the Jeppesen charts, the RNAV waypoints are circled.

Given the following information about a Commercial Air Transport operation, calculate the maximum possible Extra Fuel to be uplifted.
Maximum Zero Fuel Mass: 62 731 kg
Actual Zero Fuel Mass: 59 031 kg
Regulated Take-off Mass: 76 000 kg
Maximum Landing Mass: 66 360 kg
Fuel Tank Capacity: 16 000 kg
Taxi Fuel: 240 kg
Trip Fuel: 4761 kg
Minimum Block Fuel: 8000 kg

Explanation:
In order to find out the amount of fuel which can be uplifted you have to calculate the MTOM, MLM and tank capacity limitation - the most limiting value obtained from these calculations will be the maximum fuel which can be uplifted.
Note: MZFM does not limit fuel.
BASED ON REGULATED TAKE OFF MASS (RTOM):
RTOM – (ATOM) = 76 000 kg - 66 791 kg = 9 209 kg
ATOM = AZFM + Take Off fuel = 59 031 kg + (8 000 kg - 240 kg) = 66 791 kg
* Take Off fuel = Minimum Block Fuel - Taxi Fuel
BASED ON MAXIMUM LANDING MASS (MLM):
MLM – Landing mass = 66 360 kg - 62 030 kg = 4 330 kg
LM = ATOM - Trip fuel = 66 791 kg - 4 761 kg = 62 030 kg
BASED ON TANK CAPACITY:
16 000 kg - 8 000 kg = 8 000 kg
=> The most restricting value is based on MLM 4 330kg.

Given the following information for a Commercial Air Transport flight, what action should be taken by the Commander?
Take-Off Fuel: 3300 lb
Trip Fuel: 1800 lb
Alternate 1 Fuel: 800 lb
Alternate 2 Fuel: 500 lb
Final Reserve Fuel: 600 lb
Total Distance to Destination: 800 NM
Remaining Fuel after 400 NM: 2300 lb

Explanation:
Note: We are not entirely sure whether this question appears with this exact wording in official examinations or additional information is provided. Therefore, any feedback would be highly appreciated!
We know that the aircraft takes off with 3300 lb and that the Total Trip Distance = 800 NM.
However, after 400 NM, remaining fuel = 2300 lb
3300 - 2300 lb = 1000 lb (fuel burn for 400 nm)
Trip distance = 800 nm
1000 x 2 = 2000 lb (fuel actually burnt on trip) => This means that the Fuel Flow was higher than expected (greater trip fuel required. Planned Trip fuel = 1800 lb)
According to regulation, CAT.OP.MPA.280 In-flight fuel management – aeroplanes
(B) In-flight fuel management
1) The flight shall be conducted so that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is not less than:
(i) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel;
At the current Fuel Flow rate, overhead the destination we will have, 3300 lb - 2000 lb = 1300 lb of fuel.
Final reserve fuel = 600 lb
Therefore, we have 1300 lb - 600 lb = 700 lb of fuel remaining for Alternate Fuel.
If the aircraft was to divert to Alternate 1 it would burn 800 lb => Fuel onboard is not sufficient to reach ALT 1.
If the aircraft was to divert to Alternate 2 it would burn 500 lb => Fuel onboard sufficient to reach ALT 2 with Final Reserve Fuel intact.
=> We can proceed with the flight and in case of diversion, we would have to fly to Alternate 2.

Options:
A. B
the remaining fuel at Alternate 1 will be more than the Final Reserve Fuel.
B. C
Continue the flight; the remaining fuel at Alternate 1 will be more than the Final Reserve Fuel.
C. D
Declare an emergency as the remaining fuel is less than the Final Reserve Fuel at Alternate 1.

Question Number: AT00214
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Please refer to figure or to CAP 697, Figure 2.2, Table 2.2.1.
Determine the aircraft's drift on a course of 127°(M), given:
Level FL70; Temperature: ISA+10°C;
Power set; 2500 RPM, full throttle;
Wind: 110°(T)/50 kt;
Variation: 15°E

Images:
- images/AT00214_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
To solve this exercise, we must ensure that all directions are either in True or Magnetic. We can accomplish this by either converting the course to True or changing the wind to Magnetic.
We can use the mnemonic:
"Magnetic Variation East, Magnetic Least; Magnetic Variation West, Magnetic Best"
In this case, we've decided to convert the course to True:
Course 127º (M), Variation 15ºE
127º(M) + 15ºE = 142º (T)
For True Airspeed (TAS) at Flight Level 70 (FL70), we need to interpolate between 6 000 and 8 000 ft and ISA Dev. +20ºC, ISA Dev. 0º.
ISA Dev. +20ºC
6 000 ft 172 kt
7 000 ft (172 kt + 169 kt) / 2 = 170.5 kt
8 000 ft 169 kt

ISA Dev. 0ºC
6 000 ft 171 kt
7 000 ft (171 kt + 169 kt) / 2 = 170 kt
8 000 ft 169 kt

FL70, ISA Dev. +10ºC = (170 kt + 170.5) / 2 = 170.25 kt
Now, using the flight computer to determine drift, remember that we are using a track, not a heading.
Place the center of the rotating disk on the value representing the true airspeed (170 knots).
Position the wind direction (110º) under the true index.
Mark the wind velocity (50 knots) upwards from the center.
Note: When the question provides a track, mark wind velocity upwards from the center. When the heading is known, mark wind velocity downwards from the center.
Align your true track (142º) under the true index.
Slide the wind velocity mark to True Air Speed (170 knots).
The Wind Correction Angle (WCA) is read between the centerline and the wind velocity mark, which indicates a 9º left correction (-9º). WCA and drift are opposite in direction and of equal magnitude. So, a WCA of 9ºL corresponds to a drift of 9ºR.

Question Number: AT00215
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to Amsterdam 10-3V chart from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
The MSA is...

Images:
- images/AT00215_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA) is the lowest altitude in feet which provides a minimum vertical clearance of 1000 ft above all obstacles in an area contained within a circle of 25 NM radius centred on a ground navigational aid. MSA may be given as one value or could be divided into sub-sectors, each sector having a different value.
On a Jeppesen SID chart, MSA is depicted in maroon colour.
On the AMSTERDAM (EHAM) SID 10-3V chart, the MSA is divided into two sub-sectors by two magnetic bearings to the station (QDM) VOR/DME SPL: 357o and 310o.
If subtracted by 180o, the two bearings to the station VOR/DME SPL will be converted into Radials (QDR) and they become correspondingly:
357o - 180o = 177o
310o - 180o = 130o
The MSA as an altitude is always expressed in feet.
Therefore, the MSA is:
1 700 ft, clockwise between Radial 177 and Radial 130.
2 300 ft, clockwise between Radial 130 and Radial 177°.

Question Number: AT00217
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Determine the maximum extra fuel which can be uplifted, given:
MTOM: 56 000 lb
MLM: 45 000 lb
MZFM: 42 000 lb
DOM: 25 000 lb
Traffic Load: 9 500 lb
Trip Fuel: 10 000 lb
Planned TOF: 15 000 lb
Taxi Fuel: 300 lb
Fuel penalty: 200 lb each 1 000 lb
Tank capacity: 27 000 lb

Explanation:
In order to find out the amount of fuel which can be uplifted you have to calculate the MTOM, MLM and tank capacity limitation.
Note: MZFM does not limit fuel.
BASED ON MTOM:
MTOM – (ATOM) = 56 000 lb - 49 500 lb = 6 500 lb
ATOM = DOM + Traffic Load + Take Off fuel = 25 000 lb + 9 500 lb + 15 000 lb = 49 500 lb
BASED ON MLM:
MLM – Landing mass = 45 000 lb - 39 500 lb = 5 500 lb
LM = ATOM - Trip fuel = 49 500 lb - 10 000 lb = 39 500 lb
=> On top of this calculation, for the MLM limitation we have to apply the fuel penalty - which will be burned off during the flight.
Rule of thumb: to calculate fuel penalty, use the following formula:
(MLM extra / 1000) x Y
- where "Y" is the variable given by the question, in this case = 200
(5 500/1000) x 200 = 1 100 lb

Extra fuel that can be loaded is the sum of MLM extra (5 500 lb) and fuel penalty:
5 500 lb + 1 100 lb = 6 600 lb
BASED ON FUEL TANK CAPACITY:
Tank Capacity - Block Fuel = 27 000 lb - (15 000 lb + 300 lb) = 11 700 lb
=> The most restricting value is based on MTOM 6 500 lb

Options:
A. A
6 600 lb

11 700 lb
C. C
5 500 lb
D. D

An aircraft is planned to fly from the reporting point NORBO (N55°36', W004°46') to Dean Cross DME (DCS) (N54°43', W003°20') along airway T256. Select the appropriate magnetic course(s) and distances(s) to be entered into the navigation flight plan.

Images:
- images/AT00218_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Examine each route carefully:
The ATS route "NORBO - T256 - DCS: 144°, 71 NM. It changes into 136 M along T256 after NGY" can be assumed as correct, but it cannot be entered into a nagitation flight plan the way it is.
The ATS route "NORBO - T256 - NGY: 144°, 32 NM and NGY - T256 - DCS: 136°, 39 NM" is correct and can be entered into the navigation flight plan.
The ATS route "NORBO - T256 - DCS: 144°, 68 NM" cannot be entered, because the magnetic course changes from 144° into 136° after NGY NDB and the total distance from NORBO to Dean Cross DME is 71 NM.
The ATS route "NORBO - T256 - OSMEG: 144°, 35 NM and OSMEG - T256 - DCS: 136°, 36 NM" cannot be entered, because the magnetic course changes from 144° into 136° after NGY NDB and not after OSMEG.
Therefore, the appropriate magnetic courses and distances to be entered into the navigation flight plan is: NORBO - T256 - NGY: 144°, 32 NM and NGY - T256 - DCS: 136°, 39 NM.

To prepare for possible delays, the decision is made to include an extra 15 minutes of endurance fuel. This additional fuel should be incorporated as part of the:

Explanation:
IMPORTANT NOTE: The modifications resulting from the updated fuel policy regulations, which came into effect on October 30, 2022, are only changes in wording but nothing really new. The terminology "extra fuel" has been replaced with "discretionary fuel." EASA has clarified that the calculations and procedures pertaining to fuel calculations will remain unchanged, and there will be no inquiries regarding the "new extra fuel" concept.
extra fuel, include anticipated delays or specific operational constraints that can be predicted
discretionary fuel, include a quantity at the sole discretion of the commander
Therefore, in this case, the correct answer should be discretionary fuel, and not "extra fuel".
For reference, additional information can be found in EASA's AIR OPS documentation.
Extra fuel, now referred to as discretionary fuel, refers to any fuel quantity exceeding the minimum requirements prescribed for taxiing, the trip, and reserve fuel, as previously detailed in the regulations.
On the Captain's behalf, the decision to carry extra fuel (now, discretionary fuel) typically seeks to secure additional time for holding at the destination, primarily when delays are anticipated, or when weather conditions such as low visibility or high crosswinds may pose landing challenges. Another rationale for carrying surplus fuel could be the expectation of departure delays, like waiting in queue for takeoff at a congested airport.

An aircraft is flying a route from position A to B, a distance of 57 Nautical Ground Miles (NGM). Given the following information:
True Airspeed (TAS): 145 kt
Forecast wind: 240°/30 kt
Course: 205°(M)
Variation: 15°W
What is the distance covered in Nautical Air Miles (NAM) ?

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
Firstly, find the Groundspeed using your Flight/Nav computer:
Set wind direction 240° (T) under the True Index.
Mark wind velocity 30 kt up from centre dot.
Set True Course: 205° (M) - 15° W = 190°T under the True Index (Variation West, Magnetic Best).
Slide wind velocity mark to TAS 145 kt.
Ground speed 124 kt reads under the centre dot.
Thus, the Nautical Air Miles distance (NAM) covered is: NAM = NGM x TAS / GS = 57 NM x 145 kt / 124 kt = 66 NAMs.
NOTE: Wind directions from METAR, TAFs, and Weather charts are true. Wind directions from ATIS are magnetic.

An aircraft is scheduled to fly from Brussels (EBBR) to Malaga (LEMG) and the crew intend to use the GBAS Landing System (GLS) approach onto Runway 13 at LEMG. What is the appropriate source of information on the availability of GBAS augmentation at the estimated time of arrival?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
GBAS - GROUND BASED AUGMENTATION SYSTEM
GBAS is a system that attempts to reduce the natural errors within the GNSS system by providing very localised augmentation to the satellite signals, via a VHF data broadcast (VDB) that a suitably equipped aircraft can receive and use to fix any position errors. It is also called "differential GPS", and can correct for errors induced by satellite clocks, ephemeris and ionospheric propagation to make the augmented GNSS signal very accurate. The GBAS can also, like its satellite based cousin, SBAS, give integrity warnings about faulty satellites, as it should be able to detect this at the nearby antennas.

GBAS is limited in the fact that it is very short range, spanning approximately 30km away from the relevant ground station (which is generally an airport). The operation of GBAS allows it to work in the same way as an ILS approach, down to 200ft minimums currently (but with the ability to carry out full auto-lands with appropriate legislation), and this is called the GBAS Landing System or GLS, and is a precision approach. It is tuned using a 5 digit channel number that picks up the correct VHF datalink signals for that approach.
The availability of GBAS augmentation depends solely on the airport in question, in this case, Malaga. They are the ones who run the GBAS receivers, ground station and VDB transmitter, and therefore will mark any planned unserviceabilities as NOTAMs.
It is quite tempting to choose the AUGUR RAIM prediction as the correct answer, and this might give the pilot an idea as to how many satelllites should be available for the GNSS system, but this is not what is being asked in the question.

Refer to E(LO)5 chart from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
What must be the highest altitude of an obstacle without affecting the route segment from AKUTI (43°14'N, 008°56'E) to TORTU (43°23'N, 008°58'E) for an aircraft flying on airway A9?

Images:
- images/AT00227_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA) is the lowest published altitude in effect between radio fixes on VOR airways, off-airways routes, or route segments, which meet obstacle clearance requirements for the entire route segment. Normally, this gives 1000 ft clearance over obstacles up to and including 6000 ft and 2000 ft clearance for obstacles over 6000 ft in elevation. It is indicated on an en-route chart with "T" suffix to the minimum.
Minimum Safe En-Route IFR Altitude (MEA) is the lowest published altitude (between radio fixes) that meets obstacle clearance requirements between these fixes. The MEA applies to the entire width of the airway, segment or route between the defining radio fixes.
According to the chart, the MEA on airway A9 is FL 60 and the MOCA is 1600 ft (1600T). The required obstacle clearance is 1000 ft and with a MOCA of 1600 ft, the highest obstacle must be 600 ft or less.

A pilot is planning a VFR flight from Ajaccio (LFKJ) to Marina Di Campo (LIRJ) aerodrome with alternate aerodrome the Grosseto (LIRS). Given the following information, what is the required time from Marina Di Campo to Grosseto?
Cruise distance from LIRJ to LIRS: 24 NM
Climb from LIRJ to cruise altitude: 3 minutes
Descent to LIRS: 4 minutes
Cruise TAS: 150 kt
Wind: 050°(T)/20 kt
Track from LIRJ to LIRS: 090°(T)

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
1. Firstly, find the Groundspeed using your flight/nav computer:
Set wind direction 050°T under the True Index.
Mark wind velocity 20 kt up from centre point.
Set True Course 090°T under the True Index.
Slide wind velocity mark to TAS 150 kt.
Groundspeed reads below the centre dot 134 kt.
2. Calculate the Cruise Time from LIRJ to LIRS: Cruise distance / Groundspeed = 24 NM / 134 kt = 0.18 hr or 10.7 min.
3. The time required from the destination Marina Di Campo (LIRJ) aerodrome to the alternate aerodrome Grosseto (LIRS) is the sum of the following:
Time to climb from LIRJ to cruising level/altitude, taking into account the expected departure routing: 3 min.
Time to cruise from top of climb to top of descent, taking into account the expected routing: 10.7 min.
Time to descent from top of descent to LIRS: 4 min.
Thus, the time required is: 3 min + 10.7 min + 4 min = 17.7 min, closest answer 18 min.

Question Number: AT00230
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to ED-4 VFR chart from Jeppesen GSPRM 2017. An aircraft on a VFR flight intends to fly overhead aerodrome Straubing (EDMS) (48°54' N, 012°31' E). Given the following information, what is the minimum indicated altitude required to clear the Straubing (EDMS) Class F airspace by 500 ft?
Altimeter temperature error with an OAT -7°C at Straubing (EDMS): 240 ft
QNH at Straubing (EDMS): 998 hPa
Altimeter setting: 998 hPa
(Round altitudes and elevations to the nearest 10 ft)

Images:
- images/AT00230_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The upper vertical limit of the Straubing (EDMS) Class F airspace is 2 500 ft Above Ground Level (AGL) and the aerodrome's elevation is 1 054 ft.
The altimeter temperature error correction is given, 240 ft, because of flying within a cold atmosphere with an OAT of -7°C. The correction must be added, because the indicated altitude will be higher than the true altitude in a cold atmosphere.
The aircraft flies with an altimeter setting, 998 hPa, equal to the QNH of the Straubing aerodrome, thus no pressure correction is required.
Therefore, the minimum indicated altitude to clear the Straubing (EDMS) Class F airspace by 500 ft is: 2 500 ft + 1 054 ft + 240 ft + 500 ft = 4 294 ft.

Given the following information, Calculate the drift and groundspeed:
True Track = 020º
TAS = 180 kt
W/V = 060º(T)/30 kt

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The Drift and Groundspeed can be found using the wind side of a suitable flight computer (We have used a CRP-5 and the wind-down method here)
First, set the wind vector and TAS
Set wind direction 060ºT under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the centre point on the TAS of 180 kt
Mark the wind velocity 30 kt down from the centre point.
Initially set the true track 020°T under the "TRUE HEADING" index (to get an idea of which way the drift goes). Note that flying this heading would give 7º left drift and therefore a track of 013º, so increase the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 020º. This occurs at a heading of 026º with 6º left drift.
The groundspeed on this track is 156 kt

You lose engine power at 6500 ft over GERVU as you approach for runway 10. Which IAF will ATC likely give you?

Images:
- images/AT00232_img_1.png

Explanation:
ICAO DOC4444 Air Traffic Managament
Chapter 15
15.1.1.3 Changes of radio frequency and SSR code should be avoided if possible and should normally be made only when or if an improved service can be provided to the aircraft concerned. Maneuvering instructions to an aircraft experiencing engine failure should be limited to a minimum. When appropriate, other aircraft operating in the vicinity of the aircraft in an emergency should be advised of the circumstances.
As stated in ICAO Document 4444, ATC will clear us to the most direct route with minimum maneuvering to reduce the workload on us.
Although the BESOR and ALTET both seem appropriate, a second instruction after the BESOR point means an extra workload for the flight crew. Therefore, the most acceptable standard arrival route that ATC can give us to approach runway 10 is GERVU 1L. In this case, ATC can either clear us to execute GERVU 1L or clear us directly to ALTET.
As a result, the initial approach fix ATC likely gives us is ALTET (ALT).

A. A
BESOR IAF

Images:
- images/AT00234_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Basic Area Navigation (B-RNAV) or RNAV 5 (in Europe) was introduced to enable en-route capacity gains to be achieved with minimal aircraft capability. B-RNAV is defined as RNAV that meets a track keeping accuracy equal to or better than +/-5 NM for 95% of the flight time. This value includes signal source error, airborne receiver error, display system error, and flight technical error.
This navigation performance assumes the necessary coverage provided by satellite or ground-based navigation aids is available for the intended operation. The level of the above navigation accuracy is achieved by using Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), GPS or VHF Omni-directional Range (VOR)/DME.

Question Number: AT00237
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft on a track of 240°(M) has to overfly an obstacle of 25 700 ft with a clearance of 2000 ft. The QNH is 1 003 hPa and OAT is ISA - 12°C. What is the minimum flight level (FL) at which the aircraft may fly in RVSM airspace?
Assume 1 hPa = 30 ft

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 27 700 ft (25 700 ft + 2000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -12°C. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-12) × (27 700/1 000) = - 1330 ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­29 030 ft.

Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:

Pressure Altitude = 29 030 ft + 300 ft = 29 330 ft.
According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule:
For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)
For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)
The aircraft flies a south-westerly magnetic track of 240º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL300.
Note: RVSM airspace is between FL290 to FL410.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.

An aircraft is flying VFR using a VOR to navigate. The aircraft is following Radial 128º out from the VOR. Determine the expected Wind Correction Angle (WCA), given:
Wind: 080º (T)/35 kt
TAS: 155 kt
Variation: 15º W

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft is following radial 128º => 128º Magnetic Track.
Let’s start by converting Magnetic Track into True Track:
Variation 15ºW: Variation West => Magnetic BEST
True Track = Magnetic Track – Variation = 128º - 015º = 113º
Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track.
Set wind direction to 080º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 155 kt.
Mark the wind velocity 35 kt down from the centre point.
Initially, set the True Track to 113º under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
Note that this heading would result in 9ºR drift and a track of 122º.
Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading plus the drift gives a track of 113º. This occurs at a heading of 104º with 7ºR drift.
The groundspeed for this track is approximately 124 kt.
Wind correction angle (WCA) is the angle (º) between the Course and the Heading that is required for the aircraft to track that Course when there is wind. Wind Correction Angle is the same value as drift but it is applied in the opposite sense: (-)7ºL WCA

Determine the total endurance of the flight, given:
Remaining fuel: 2400 kg
Average fuel flow: 800 kg/h
Final Reserve Fuel: 400 kg
Specific Fuel Consumption: 2.3 kg/NGM
Average Ground Speed: 350 kt

Explanation:
Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) is a measure of engine efficiency expressed as the fuel flow per unit of thrust. Thus, a low SFC indicates an efficient engine.
Endurance is a measure of how long the fuel will last and is therefore inversely proportional to the fuel flow or Endurance = fuel ÷ fuel flow. Thus, high fuel flow indicates a low value for endurance.
In this case, fuel remaining equals 2 400 kg and the average fuel flow is 800 kg/h:
Endurance = 2 400 kg ÷ 800 kg/h = 3 hours (180 minutes)
Note: Total Endurance is the amount of time an aircraft can stay in the air until its tanks are dry (which includes final reserve fuel).

Given the following information, calculate the drift angle:
TAS: 179 kt
Wind: 330°(M)/25 kt
VAR: 20°W
Course: 210°(M)

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
CRP5: Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track.
Set wind direction to 330°M under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 179 kt.
Mark the wind velocity 25 kt down from the centre point.
Initially, set the True Track to 210° under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
Note that this heading would result in 6°L drift and a track of 204°.
Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 210°. This occurs at a heading of 216° with 7°L drift.
The groundspeed for this track is approximately 192 kt.
CR3:
Set the TAS index to a value below 17.9 (which corresponds to a TAS of 179 kt).
Rotate the green scale until the True Course (190°) aligns with the TC index.
Locate the 330° wind direction line on the green scale. At the point where this line intersects the 25 kt wind velocity circle, make a pencil mark.
From the pencil mark, we observe that there is a right crosswind component of 16 kt. According to the flight computer's outer scale, this corresponds to a crab angle of approximately 7°.
Given the right crosswind component, the True Heading will be 7° to the right of the True Course. Therefore:
Wind correction angle (WCA): 7° right
Drift angle: 7° left.

Question Number: AT00248
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

After an engine failure, the Commander of a Medium-Range Jet Transport (MRJT) aeroplane executes a drift-down procedure and stabilizes at a cruising altitude significantly below the normal cruising altitude. His/her decision to proceed to an adequate alternate, increases significantly the fuel consumption compared to the planned consumption. Although he/she has planned for Trip Fuel, Contingency Fuel, Alternate Fuel and Final Reserve Fuel, he/she has NOT included in the fuel planning a sufficient quantity for this engine-out situation. Which option is correct for the above scenario?

Explanation:
Additional fuel is an amount of fuel which is only applicable to some operations and it can cater for the “what ifs” at the most critical point.
Following loss of pressurisation, the drill will be to perform an emergency descent from cruise altitude down to 10 000 ft. Having completed the descent, the aircraft must divert and the fuel must be enough for this scenario. This case would increase the fuel consumption, since the aircraft flies at a lower altitude than normal and at a lower airspeed.
As a consequence, further uplifted fuel must be calculated during the pre-flight planning procedure, including fuel to descend as necessary, proceed to an adequate aerodrome, hold for 15 minutes at 1 500 ft and execute an approach/landing. This element of fuel would appear as Additional fuel on the flight plan, ensuring that sufficient fuel is carried for such an event.
In normal conditions, when no alternate is required, the additional fuel is fuel for 15 minutes holding at 1 500 ft above the destination aerodrome elevation in standard conditions.

Options:
A. A
The Final Reserve Fuel must plan for such an event, and the fuel planning must therefore be INCORRECT.
B. B
Fuel for this event must be included in the Contingency Fuel; the fuel planning is therefore INCORRECT.
C. C
The Alternate Fuel must plan for such an event, and the fuel planning must therefore be INCORRECT.
D. D
The Additional Fuel ensures that sufficient fuel is carried for such an event. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00249
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

What is the difference between an RNAV STAR and RNAV STAR overlay?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
An approach can be performed using the overlay method with charts such as this conventional approach (NDB) chart. This chart observes two different flight paths; CDFA (solid line) and non-CDFA (dashed). In addition, the missed approach point is indicated on the chart for both approach types. When in doubt when approaching using the overlay method, rely on conventional methods.
The conventional Standard Arrival Route procedures (STARs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV STARs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS.
RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these.
An RNAV STAR overlay is a traditional STAR that allows pilots to use GNSS equipment to fly existing, conventional STAR procedures, without replacing it.
It follows the same route as the conventional procedure, with waypoints defined by coordinates instead of bearings and distances from ground navigation aids. In most cases, each ground navigation aid or intersection point of the conventional STAR, corresponds to an RNAV waypoint. Additionally, some RNAV waypoints (Fly-by or Fly-over) may be added, non-existing in the conventional STAR, to facilitate the turns.
An RNAV STAR overlay may be either shorter or longer in distance than an RNAV STAR, depending on the design.

Explanation Images:

Options:
A. A
The RNAV STAR overlay is a shorter route than the RNAV STAR.
B. B
The RNAV STAR overlay will follow a different route from the conventional STAR procedure.
C. D
The RNAV STAR overlay is a longer route than the RNAV STAR.
D. C
The RNAV STAR overlay permits pilots to fly a conventional STAR procedure using GNSS equipment. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00250
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Which of the following is(are) Type A approach(es)?
1. ILS with MDH>250 ft
2. VOR with MDH=270 ft
3. VOR with MDH=240 ft
4. ILS with MDH=50 ft

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
According to ICAO Annex 6, Annex 10 and Annex 14, there are two types of classification for approach operations, dependent upon the achieved minima at the end of the approach:
Type A: may be either 2D or 3D operations; 2D will only have a lateral path defined for the approach operation where 3D will have both a lateral and vertical path defined for that operation. A Type A operation will permit aircraft operations down to a minimum height or altitude of 250 ft. All NPAs and Approcahes with Vertical guidance (APV) using Barometric altimetry are Type A approach operations.
Type B: are 3D operations; a lateral and vertical path is defined and guidance along this path is provided either from GPS with SBAS (APV SBAS) or by a precision approach system.
Thus, Type A approaches are 1. ILS with MDH > 250 ft and 2. VOR with MDH = 270 ft.
Important Note: "3. VOR with MDH = 240 ft" is not possible as VOR/DME approaches have a system minima of 250 ft, so cannot have a MDH below this value. This makes it not possible as an approach at all, and could potentially make this question worthy of an appeal, as it is misleading. Any further exam feedback about this can be put in the comments or sent to info@atplquestions.com, thank you.

Question Number: AT00251
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A flight from aerodrome H to aerodrome G is planned using the Reduced Contingency Fuel (RCF) procedure aiming to increase the traffic load. The decision point along the route is DP and aerodrome R is the optional refuelling destination. Given the following data, calculate the minimum fuel required for from H to G.
Taxi fuel at aerodrome H: 160 kg
Final Reserve Fuel: 1 200 kg
Trip fuel from H to G via DP: 7 800 kg
Trip fuel from H to R via DP: 7 250 kg
Trip fuel from DP to G: 3 050 kg
Alternate fuel and Extra Fuel is NOT required and an En-Route Alternate aerodrome (ERA) for the optional refuel station is NOT available.

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
When an operator's fuel policy includes pre-flight using Reduced Contingency Fuel (RCF) procedure to a Destination G aerodrome (commercial destination), a Decision Point (DP) will be defined enroute along with a Destination R aerodrome (optional refuelling destination), the amount of usable fuel, on board for departure, shall be the greater of (1) or (2) below:
(1) The sum of:
Taxi fuel: 160 kg
Trip fuel to the destination G aerodrome, via the decision point DP: 7 800 kg
Contingency fuel equal to not less than 5 % of the estimated fuel consumption from the decision point DP to the destination G aerodrome: 5% x 3 050 kg = 152.5 kg
Alternate fuel: 0 kg
Final reserve fuel: 1 200 kg
Additional fuel: 0
Extra fuel: 0
RCF1: 9 312.5 kg
(2) The sum of:
Taxi fuel: 160 kg
Trip fuel to the destination R aerodrome, via the decision point DP: 7 250 kg
Contingency fuel equal to not less than the amount that is calculated in accordance with point (c)* of this AMC, from the departure aerodrome to the destination 2 aerodrome: 5% x 7 250 kg = 363 kg
or
an amount to fly for 5 minutes at holding speed at 1 500 ft (450 m), above the destination aerodrome in standard conditions: In this case, the question does not provide fuel flow, so we are unable to calculate this.
Alternate fuel: 0 kg
Final reserve fuel: 1 200 kg,
Additional fuel: 0
Extra fuel: 0
RCF2: 8 973 kg
The greater sum between RCF1 and RCF2 is RCF1: 9 312.5 kg, closest answer 9 313 kg.
Note: 95 % of the time RCF 1 (A to B) will require the largest total fuel. However, always calculate RCF 2, because there are questions where that is the largest.

Refer to Nantes chart 19-1 from Jeppesen GSPRM. An aeroplane is departing from Nantes to conduct VFR flight to the northwest and will cross waypoint (NW). What will be the best visual check point to check the position at waypoint (NW).

Images:
- images/AT00252_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
During VFR flights you can best pinpoint your position using unique line features, such as railway lines, motorways or junctions of those. Small built-up areas are recommended, when they are isolated and close to obvious ground features, such as lakes, reservoirs, junctions and nearby to identify it.
Choice of the ground features is critical, as things that show up well on maps do not necessarily show up well from the air. In the vicinity of Nantes aerodrome there are many identical ground features, such as lighted masts, which can cause confusion to the pilot's flight monitoring, since they cannot be considered as unique.
In this case, the best option to check the position at waypoint "NW", is by looking for the highway junction, which is the only junction in that area and at a distance from the other motorway junctions, so as to ensure that the planned route is followed and to correct promptly any inattention which may cause any inadvertent drift.

Refer to figure.
Refer to CAP 697 Figure 3.4. From the meteorology charts for your route, you make the following observations:
Pressure Altitude 4000 ft: OAT+11°C, headwind component 10 kt
Pressure Altitude 6000 ft: OAT+07°C, headwind component 10 kt
Pressure Altitude 7000 ft: OAT+02°C, headwind component 12 kt
Pressure Altitude 8000 ft: OAT+0°C, headwind component 20 kt
The fuel flow given for flying at 45% power is 16 gallons per hour.
What should be the most fuel efficient pressure altitude to fly a route distance of 300 NM?

Images:
- images/AT00253_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The most fuel efficient pressure altitude is that which gives the greatest Groundspeed so as to fly the route distance of 300 NM at the least possible flight time, burning the least possible fuel amount, for a given power setting (45% in our case) and constant fuel flow.
First of all, find the corresponding TAS for each combination of Pressure altitude and OAT given, following the steps below:
Enter with the OAT from the bottom left side of the graph.
Move vertically up to intersect the corresponding pressure altitude line.
Continue horizontally to the right, until you intersect the corresponding power setting line (45% for this question).
Move vertically down to read the TAS.
For each combination of Pressure Altitude, OAT and wind component given, the Groundspeed is:
PA 4000 ft, OAT+11°C: TAS 133 kt - 10 kt = 123 kt
PA 6000 ft, OAT+07°C: TAS 136 kt -10 kt = 126 kt
PA 7000 ft, OAT+02°C: TAS 137 kt -12 kt = 125 kt
PA 8000 ft, OAT+0°C: TAS 139 kt -20 kt = 119 kt
The greatest Grounspeed was found at Pressure Altitude 6000 ft, which means that cruising at this pressure altitude the aircraft will cover 300 NM at the least cruise flight time with the least fuel consumption.

Question Number: AT00254
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to figure.
Given the following data, determine the required Alternate Fuel.
Distance: 130 NM
Wind: 20 kt Headwind
Landing weight: 55 tons

Images:
- images/AT00254_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Referring to the upper table, interpolate to get the NAM for Distance 130 NM:
Ground Distance of 100 NM, headwind component of 20 kt: Air Distance 108 NM
Ground Distance of 150 NM, headwind component of 20 kt: Air Distance 161 NM
From the above, we can conclude the following:
For a Ground Distance increase of 50 NM (100 NM to 150 NM), the Air Distance increases by 53 NM (108 NM to 161 NM)
Therefore, when the Ground Distance increases by 30 NM (100 NM to 130 NM), the Air Distance will increase by: (53 x 30) / 50 = approx. 32 NM
The Air Distance for a Ground Distance of 130 NM equals: 108 NM + 32 NM = 140 NM
Referring to the lower table, we can interpolate to get the required alternate fuel:
For a LW of 55 000 kg and for an Air distance of 100 NM: fuel required equals 1 000 kg
For a LW of 55 000 kg and for an Air distance of 150 NM: fuel required equals 1 300 kg
From the above, we can conclude the following:
For a Air Distance increase of 50 NM (100 NM to 150 NM), the fuel required increases by 300 kg (1 000 kg to 1 300 kg)
Therefore, when the Air Distance increases by 40 NM (100 NM to 140 NM), the fuel required will increase by: (40 x 300) / 50 = approx. 240 kg
The fuel required for an Air Distance of 140 NM equals: 1 000 kg + 240 kg = 1 240 kg

You want to plan a very accurate VFR route within a controlled airspace. Which of the following landmarks do you consider best suited for insertion into a GNSS flight plan using coordinates?

Explanation:
When flying within a controlled airspace, a detailed and accurate pre-flight planning procedure is required, because of the increased traffic and if using a GNSS flight plan, the selection of the visual reference points is a little differentiated.
The best landmarks suited for insertion into a GNSS flight plan are landmarks which cover a spot rather than an area, because the coordinates inserted in a GPS device are more precise, in a decimal form in most cases.
The motorway or railroad junctions consist a spot, whilst the large wooden areas, the lakes and rivers and the major cities are larger areas with coordinates that correspond to areas and not to visual reference points.

Options:
A. A

Question Number: AT00259
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Given the following information for a Commercial Air Transport operation, calculate the maximum possible Extra Fuel, including any fuel penalty, that can be uplifted.
MTOM: 233 000 kg
MLM: 182 000 kg
MZFM: 170 000 kg
DOM: 122 550 kg
Traffic Load: 35367 kg
Trip Fuel: 62332 kg
Planned T/O Fuel: 67885 kg
Taxi Fuel: 300 kg
Fuel penalty for carrying Extra Fuel: 394 kg per 1000 kg of Extra Fuel
Fuel tank capacity: 110 000 kg

Explanation:
In order to find out the amount of fuel which can be uplifted you have to calculate the MTOM, MLM and tank capacity limitation - the most limiting value obtained from these calculations will be the maximum fuel which can be uplifted.
Note: MZFM does not limit fuel.
BASED ON MAXIMUM TAKE OFF MASS (MTOM):
MTOM – (ATOM) = 233 000 kg - 225 802 kg = 7 198 kg
Actual Take off mass ATOM = Dry Operating Mass (DOM) + Traffic load (TL) + Take Off fuel (TOF) = 122 550 kg + 35 367 kg + 67 885 kg = 225 802 kg
BASED ON MAXIMUM LANDING MASS MLM:
MLM – Landing mass = 182 000 kg - 163 470 kg = 18 530 kg
LM = ATOM - Trip fuel = 225 802 kg - 62 332 kg = 163 470 kg
On top of this calculation, for the MLM limitation we have to apply the fuel penalty - which will be burned off during the flight
Rule of thumb: to calculate fuel penalty, use the following formula:
(MLM extra / 1000) x Y
- where "Y" is the variable given by the question, in this case = 394
(18 530/1000) x 394 = 7301 kg
Extra fuel that can be loaded is the sum of MLM extra (3580 kg) and fuel penalty:
18 530 kg + 7301 kg = 25 831 kg
BASED ON FUEL TANK CAPACITY:
Maximum Tank Capacity - (Take off fuel + Taxi fuel)
110 000 kg - (67 885 kg + 300 kg) = 41 815 kg
=> The most restricting value in based on MTOM: 7198 kg

Options:
A. B
6898 kg
B. C
12751 kg
C. D
18530 kg
D. A
7198 kg ✓ (CORRECT)

A Pilot-in-Command is planning to conduct a single published RNP approach. During the pre-flight planning preparation, he/she must check that (1) _____ based facilities are (2) _____ at the estimated time of arrival.

Explanation:
Non-augmented GNSS simply use the satellites in sight and positioning. Timing errors or the loss of a satellite signal are not notified to the flight deck nor is the error in the position a solution.
Thus, it is important before flight to check the availability of the relevant satellites and any potential outages for an accurate position at all stages of the flight, but especially for the destination airfield and alternate at the estimated times of arrival.
This GNSS achievability can be verified by checking NOTAMs and the Notice Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU) messages, which are issued jointly by the United States Coast Guard and the GPS Operations Centre in Colorado and provides updates on the GPS constellation.
NANUs are issued 72 hours (3 days) before any change of a GPS satellite.

- images/AT00261_img_3.png
- images/AT00261_img_4.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Some Approach charts require specific ground navigational aids. In case the required aids are unavailable or inoperative, the approach procedure cannot be conducted.
For this question, check carefully each approach chart, if there is any note which demands an ADF requirement or not:
Each one of the charts 13-1 (VOR Z Rwy 10) and 13-2 (VOR Y Rwy 10), do not mention anywhere for any ADF requirement. Thus, if ADF is inoperative due to broken frequency selector parts ordered, both VOR approach procedures are available.
Each one of the charts 11-1 (ILS Z Rwy 10 or LOC A) and 11-2 (ILS Y Rwy 10 or LOC B), contain an information box, according to which: "VOR/DME and ADF is required". Therefore, if ADF is inoperative due to broken frequency selector parts ordered, both ILS or LOC approach procedures are unavailable.

Refer to AMSTERDAM - Chart 10-3Q from Jeppesen GSPRM 2017. What is the difference between EHØ48 and EHØ8Ø?

Images:
- images/AT00262_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
A fly-by waypoint is a waypoint where the turn is started just before the waypoint is reached so that the arc of the turn comes closest to the direct track to and from the waypoint. A fly-over waypoint is as it says, the aircraft has to actually pass overhead the waypoint before taking up the course for the next leg. A fly-by waypoint allows the turn to start just before the waypoint overhead - turn anticipation.
This is the standard turning method for FMS and INS systems and represents the most efficient turn.
A fly-over waypoint is the point at which a turn is initiated in order to join the next segment of a route or procedure. A fly-over waypoint requires the aircraft to actually get to the waypoint before the turn is initiated and therefore there is always an element of overshoot.
The symbols for a fly-by and a fly-over waypoint in aeronautical maps and charts can be differentiated by the circle surrounding fly-over waypoints.
According to the route description at the bottom section of the AMSTERDAM (EHAM) 10-3Q chart, all aircraft, apart from B737, must fly overhead EHØ48.
Therefore, for all aircraft other than B737, the EHØ48 RNAV waypoint is fly-by. But for B737 aircraft EHØ8Ø RNAV waypoint is a fly-over one.

Flight time: 2 hours and 30 minutes
Top of climb to top of descent time: 2 hours
Alternate fuel: to fly for 45 minutes plus 15% of the flying time planned to be spent at cruising level
Normal fuel consumption cruise: 720 kg per hour

Explanation:
Isolated aerodrome is one for which the alternate and final fuel reserve required to the nearest adequate destination alternate aerodrome is more than:
for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, fuel to fly for 45 minutes plus 15% of the flying time planned to be spent at cruising level or two hours, whichever is less or
for aeroplanes with turbine engines, fuel to fly for two hours at normal cruise consumption above the destination aerodrome, including final reserve fuel.
Thus, the reciprocating-engined aircraft must have a minimum amount of fuel required, when overhead the isolated aerodrome of: (45/60 x 720 kg) + (15% x 2 hr x 720 kg) = 540 kg + 216 kg = 756 kg, to the nearest 10 kg: 760 kg.

Options:
A. A
820 kg
B. B
740 kg
C. C
540 kg
D. D
760 kg ✓ (CORRECT)

Correct Answer: D.

Question Number: AT00265
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft of an IFR flight on a track of 225°(M) has to clear an obstacle of 6 600 ft by 1 500 ft. If the QNH is 1030 hPa and the temperature is ISA -15°C, what is the lowest Flight Level at which the aircraft may fly to clear the obstacle? (Assume 30 ft per hPa)

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 8 100 ft (6 600 ft + 1 500 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -15ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-15) × (8 100/1000) = -486 ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­8 586 ft.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1030 hPa - 1013 hPa = 17 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 17 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 510 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 8 586 ft - 510 ft = 8 076 ft.
According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290:
For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)
For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)
The aircraft flies a westerly magnetic track of 225o(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL100.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.
Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.

Question Number: AT00266
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

In order to follow the planned track, a pilot flies a True Heading of 040º, which was calculated for the forecast wind of 100°/40kt. The actual wind encountered at his/her altitude is 160°/40kt.
What will the in-flight track be?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The easiest and fastest way to solve this exercise is by drawing vectors:
In both cases (forecast and actual wind), the wind comes from the right, causing a left drift. The wind vector will be the same length for both scenarios (= wind speed).
Start by drawing your aircraft and its True heading (040º). From this point, draw a vector representing the forecast wind of 100º. Draw a line which depicts the planned track by adding the vectors.
Now, draw a second vector, with the same length as the first one but this time with the approximate direction of the actual wind experienced (160º). Draw the actual track by adding the vectors.
As you can see in the attached figure, the forecasted wind 100º/40 kt will cause a greater left drift and, as a result, the actual track flown will be to the right of the planned.

An aircraft is flying a commercial air transport route and making fuel checks at positions TESGA and BABIT. Referring to the data from these checks, what is the total fuel consumption from TESGA to BABIT and the average fuel flow (FF)?

Images:
- images/AT00267_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Note that actual figures must be used - Actual time overhead (ATO) and Actual fuel on board (AFOB) and not estimated times.
Calculate the actual flight time between TESGA - BABIT:
Flight time TESGA - BABIT = Actual time overhead BABIT - Actual time overhead TESGA
Flight time TESGA - BABIT = 24 h 51 - 23 h 48 = 1 h 3 min
(1) Calculate the actual fuel burnt and fuel consumption: TESGA - BABIT
Fuel consumed TESGA - BABIT = Fuel onboard at TESGA - Fuel onboard at BABIT
Fuel consumed TESGA - BABIT = 12.3 t - 9 t
Fuel consumed TESGA - BABIT = 3.3 t
Fuel Consumption = 3.3 t / 1 h 3 min = 3.14 t/h

Question Number: AT00268
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A large jet aeroplane is planning to depart for an isolated destination aerodrome, as a Commercial Air Transport operation. The flight time is 3 hours and the normal fuel consumption at cruise is 2648 kg per hour. The pre-flight calculation of usable fuel required for the flight includes the items listed below.
Given the following fuel load, how much more fuel needs to be loaded to achieve the legal requirement for additional fuel.
Taxi Fuel: 180 kg
Trip Fuel: 7942 kg
Contingency Fuel: 398 kg
Final Reserve Fuel: 1107 kg

Explanation:
When planning a flight to an isolated aerodrome, an aircraft with turbine engines is required to arrive with enough fuel to fly for two hours at cruise consumption. Two hours with the given cruise consumption of 2 648 kg/h is equal to a remaining fuel mass of 2 648 kg/h x 2 h = 5 296 kg
The planned final reserve fuel for the destination is 1 107 kg, which can be excluded when calculating the remaining fuel. Therefore, we need an additional fuel mass of 5 296 kg – 1 107 kg = 4 189 kg
Note: Final Reserve fuel is included in additional fuel, we can also solve the question like below;
Calculate Additional fuel, which is 2 648 * 2 = 5296 (2h cruise consumption in turbine aircraft)
As we know that the final reserve is included in 5 296 kg and we have to substract it, because 1 107 kg is already in 5 296 kg. So the fuel we must add is the result of our calculated additional minus final reserve we have on board, 5296-1107=4189
The reason of final reserve fuel is given to confuse us.
Remember that, we need a total of 5 296 kg of Additional fuel, we have 1 107 kg of Final Reserve that is included, so we just need 4189 kg more.

Options:
A. A
5296 kg
B. B

D. D
4189 kg ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00269
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

You have planned to fly from airport A to airport B, which is 460 NM away. After 1 hour 20 minutes of flight time, covering a distance of 187 NM, the remaining fuel is 795 lbs plus the reserves. Given the following information, and assuming conditions remain the same, what will be the remaining fuel at airport B?
Average TAS: 120 kt
Wind component: 20 kt tailwind
Trip fuel: 1 314 lbs
Planned average fuel flow : 400 lb/h

Explanation:
Note: Question asks us to assume that conditions remain the same, meaning that we should calculate the actual fuel consumption and ground speed during the first 187 NM (disregarding the Fuel Flow/GS provided by the question).
1) Determine Fuel consumed and fuel consumption during the first 187 NM:
Fuel Consumed = 1 314 lb - 795 lb = 519 lb
Fuel Consumption = (519 lb / 80 min) x 60 min/h
Fuel Consumption = 389.25 lb/h
2) Actual Ground Speed during the first 187 NM:
Ground Speed = TAS + tailwind = 120 kt + 20 kt = 140 kt
3) Calculate remaining distance and flight time:
Remaining distance = 460 NM - 187 NM = 273 NM
Remaining Flight time = 273 NM / 140 kt = 1.95 h
4) Calculate fuel consumed during the remaining distance:
Fuel Consumed = 1.95 h x 389.25 lb/h = 759 lb
5) Remaining fuel at airport B:
795 lb - 759 lb = 36 lb = 36 lb + reserves

Options:
A. B
15 lb plus reserves.
B. C
184 lb plus reserves.
C. D
167 lb plus reserves.
D. A
36 lb plus reserves. ✓ (CORRECT)

Which of the following is(are) Type B approach(es)?
1. ILS DH = 230 ft
2. VOR DH = 250 ft
3. VOR DH = 270 ft

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
ICAO has divided approaches into type A and type B, depending on what level of ground facilities, lights and marking they need.
A type A approach is any approach with its minima at 250 ft and higher, which generally corresponds to 2D approaches, but occasionally a 3D approach will also have such minima if located in an area restricted by obstacles. For example, an ILS in a mountainous terrain with a decision height of 250 ft is for the airport a type A approach, although it's a 3D approach for the pilot.
Type B approaches are those with their minima below 250 ft, which corresponds only to 3D approaches.
In this case, the only correct option is definitely "1 only". However, the student who came across this question believes this option was not within the available answers. As none of the remaining options makes sense, we would appreciate any information you can provide on this question.

An aircraft is flying along airway Y906 and approaches RIMOL (N57°33' W004°03'). If the magnetic wind is 345°/50 kt and the TAS is 200 kt, what is the wind correction angle if the pilot wants to continue south on airway N560 inbound Glasgow VOR?

Images:
- images/AT00273_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
If you fly on airway N560 from RIMOL towards GLASGOW => on the chart, you can see your track is 191º.
Track 191º; Wind 345º/50kt; TAS 200 kts
Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track.
Set wind direction to 345º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 200 kt.
Mark the wind velocity 50 kt down from the centre point.
Initially, set the True Track to 191º under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
Note that this heading would result in 5ºL drift and a track of 186º.
Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 191º. This occurs at a heading of 196º with 6ºL drift.
The groundspeed for this track is approximately 244 kt.
Wind correction angle (WCA) is the angle (º) between the Course and the Heading that is required for the aircraft to track that Course when there is wind. Wind Correction Angle is the same value as drift but it is applied in the opposite sense: (+)6ºR WCA

For Mass and Balance and Aerodynamic purposes, a pilot decides to refuell only the inner and outer wing tanks on both sides, while the centre tank remains empty. How much fuel is available ?

Images:
- images/AT00274_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The mass of the wing affects the likelihood of flutter. A lighter wing is more susceptible to a high frequency flutter. For aerodynamic and stability purposes, the fuel may, therefore, be retained in the wing tanks, both inner and outer, not only to reduce the stress on the wing spar, but also to reduce the onset of flutter and increase lateral stability.
If the pilot decides to refuell only the wing tanks, both inner and outer, for the forementioned purposes, then the total fuel available on-board will be: (Outer tanks x 2) + (Inner tanks x 2) = (691 kg x 2) + (5 435 kg x 2) = 1 382 kg + 10 870 kg = 12 252 kg.

Question Number: AT00276
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Which of the following is(are) Type A approach(es)?
1. ILS with DH: 270 ft
2. VOR with MDH: 250 ft
3. VOR with MDH: 200 ft
4. ILS with DH: 140 ft

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
According to ICAO Annex 6, Annex 10 and Annex 14, there are two types of classification for approach operations, dependent upon the achieved minima at the end of the approach:
Type A: may be either 2D or 3D operations; 2D will only have a lateral path defined for the approach operation where 3D will have both a lateral and vertical path defined for that operation. A Type A operation will permit aircraft operations down to a minimum height or altitude of 250 ft. All NPAs and Approcahes with Vertical guidance (APV) using Barometric altimetry are Type A approach operations.
Type B: are 3D operations; a lateral and vertical path is defined and guidance along this path is provided either from GPS with SBAS (APV SBAS) or by a precision approach system.
Thus, Type A approaches are 1. ILS with DH > 250 ft and 2. VOR with MDH = 250 ft.
Important Note: "3. VOR with MDH = 200 ft" is not possible as VOR/DME approaches have a system minima of 250 ft, so cannot have a MDH below this value. This makes it not possible as an approach at all, and could potentially make this question worthy of an appeal, as it is misleading. Any further exam feedback about this can be put in the comments or sent to info@atplquestions.com, thank you.

Images:
- images/AT00277_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track.
Set wind direction to 340º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 135 kt.
Mark the wind velocity 20 kt down from the centre point.
Initially, set the True Track to 271º under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
Note that this heading would result in 8ºL drift and a track of 263º.
Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 271º. This occurs at a heading of 279º with 8ºL drift.
The groundspeed for this track is approximately 127 kt.
Wind correction angle (WCA) is the angle (º) between the Course and the Heading that is required for the aircraft to track that Course when there is wind. Wind Correction Angle is the same value as drift but it is applied in the opposite sense: (+)8ºR WCA

How do you determine the position of a significant VFR waypoint for insertion into a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) flight plan?

Explanation:
Although operating VFR, a significant VFR point (i.e. Fixpoint or VFR reporting point) can be inserted into a GNSS flight plan, even if it is not held in the database, by defining it as a distance and bearing from an existing significant point (Geographic point or VOR/DME) or by coordinates.
A waypoint on a low altitude IFR chart is not relevant to a VFR point.
A bearing and distance from a city, town or village is not accurate or practical and will not necessarily be in the flight plan.

Options:
A. B
By using the name of a conspicuous city in the vicinity of the route and bearing and distance from there.
B. C
By inserting the coordinates of the reference point of an aerodrome and bearing and distance to the significant VFR point.

Question Number: AT00280
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A crew plans a route on which the Grid Minimum off route Altitude (Grid MORA) for the first section of the route is 7600 feet. The route is in mountainous terrain so 2000 feet obstacle clearance is required. Given the following information, what is the minimum flight level (FL) to fly for this part of the route?
Elevation of departure aerodrome: 178 ft
QNH at departure aerodrome: 986 hPa
ISA deviation: -17° C
Pressure correction: 1 hPa 30

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 7 600 ft (Grid MORA already provides 2 000 feet clearance in Mountainous regions). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -17ºC. For the temperature correction, the air column between the airfield and the aircraft must be taken into account: 7 600 ft - 178 ft = 7 422 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-17) × (7 422/1 000) = -505 ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 7 600 ft + 505 ft = 8 105 ft.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 986 hPa = 27 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 27 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 810 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 8 105 ft + 810 ft = 8 915 ft.
The Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL90.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.
Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.
True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.

Question Number: AT00283

You are planning a flight which passes through LIMM (Milan FIR). There are no reports of CB activity on the significant weather charts or SIGMETs, however you notice significant thunderstorm activity on a specialised weather website for an area close to your intended routing. How should you proceed?

Explanation:
Traditionally, the best sources of weather for a flight were the official sources, sig wx. charts, SIGMETs, AIRMETs, upper wind and pressure charts, METARs, TAFs, etc. These sources are specifically designed for flight operations and regulated for accuracy and safety. Therefore, weather decisions should be made based on these approved, regulated sources.
These days, though, easily accessible weather apps have become very useful for live weather information, as well as good forecasting with detailed information that you might not be able to get from official sources. As they are not regulated though, they may not be held to the same standards and are not allowed to be the sole weather information for aviation purposes.
The best approach is to use regulated weather sources such as SIGMETs, METARs and TAFs as the primary weather sources for decision making and, this can then be supplemented by using a weather app for a better understanding of the expected weather.
Therefore, the best option here is NOT to continue anyway as if the thunderstorms are not present, and is NOT to postpone the flight completely, but instead perhaps to call the WAFC and request further information which you can then rely upon as being a usable information source.

Options:
A. B
If there is no indication on the SIGMET or significant weather charts, you can disregard the information from the specialised weather website.
B. C
You must postpone the flight until official sources confirm the presence or absence of thunderstorms along the route.
C. D
You can use any piece of available information, including the website, to prepare the flight and anticipate or deviate around the weather.
D. A
You may only use official weather information sources for flight planning, but you can always contact the WAFC for further clarification or additional information. ✓ (CORRECT)

Refer to figure.
You are about to take a VFR flight in Summer with no serviceable radio aids on board your aircraft. The flight is likely to occur in haze in the late afternoon, with the Sun deteriorating visibility even more. Which route should you plan to take?

Images:
- images/AT00284_img_1.png

Explanation:
VFR navigation is highly affected by the choice of route, and particularly features to use for turning points or tracking.
In this case, with quite poor visibility, due to the haze and the Sun to the West, the best way to navigate given here is to use the large line features of the highway and the river, which can be followed all the way to the destination.
It does not add too much distance to the route, but does make sure that the pilot will always know their position and will not become lost or disorientated.
The VOR cannot be used for navigation due to the lack of serviceable equipment on the aircraft.
The tall mast may be an acceptable turning point, but might be difficult to identify in the Sun and the haze, and the long legs with reduced visibility could lead the aircraft to being off course and have a higher chance of getting the pilot lost than following the highway and river.
The 4th route is not even on the map, and is similar to using the mast, though it is much likely easier to find, but is large and therefore less accurate as a position fix.

Options:
A. B
Route 3 via the tall mast.
B. C
Route 4 via the big city of Regensburg.

An aircraft is flying a route from position A to B, a distance of 57 Nautical Ground Miles (NGM). Given the following information:
True Airspeed (TAS): 125 kt
Forecast wind: 240°/30 kt
Course: 205° (M)
Variation: 15° W
What is the distance covered in Nautical Air Miles (NAM) ?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Firstly, using your Flight/Nav computer find the Groundspeed:
Set wind direction 240° under the True Index.
Mark wind velocity 30 kt up from centre dot.
Set True Course: 205° (M) - 15° W = 190° under the True Index (Variation West, Magnetic Best).
Slide wind velocity mark to TAS 125 kt.
Ground speed 104 kt reads under the centre dot.
Thus, the Nautical Air Miles distance (NAM) covered is: NAM = NGM x TAS / GS = 57 NM x 125 kt / 104 kt = 68.5 NAMs.
NOTE: Wind directions from METAR, TAFs, and Weather charts are true. Wind directions from ATIS are magnetic.

Which of the following circumstances would be considered suitable for fuel tankering?
1. The fuel price at the departure aerodrome is higher than that at the destination.
2. The fuel price ratio, departure to destination, is greater than 1.
3. There is no fuel available at the destination aerodrome.

Explanation:
Aviation is a very competitive market and each airline needs to minimise operating costs, in order to keep its ticket prices as competitive as possible. Fuel tankering is a practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its next flight (trip fuel + reserve) in order to reduce or avoid refuelling at the destination airport. However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions.
Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the break even fuel price.
You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if:
Adverse destination weather The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome
Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop
The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass

An aircraft on a track of 130º(M) has to overfly an obstacle of 26500 ft with a clearance of 2000 ft. The QNH is 1003 hPa and OAT is ISA + 10º C. What is the minimum flight level (FL) at which the aircraft may fly in RVSM airspace?
Assume 1 hPa = 30 ft

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 28 500 ft (26 500 ft + 2 000 ft). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (28 500/1 000) = 1 140ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is subtracted from the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of ­­27 360 ft.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 300 ft. This value needs to be added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below:

Pressure Altitude = 27 360 ft + 300 ft = 27 660 ft.

According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290:
For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)
For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)
The aircraft flies a south-easterly magnetic track of 130º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL290.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.

Question Number: AT00294
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

What is the required horizontal distance, measured from an airfield at sea level, to initiate a descent from an altitude of 17 000 ft and reach an altitude of 2 000 ft while being 10 NM away from the airfield? The descent rate is set at 1 500 ft/min, and the ground speed is 180 kt.

Explanation:
The aircraft is currently at 17 000 ft and is required to descend to 2 000 ft which means that it must descend 15 000 ft.
With a rate of descent of 1 500 ft/min, the aircraft will take 10 minutes to descend 15 000 ft (15 000 ft ÷ 1 500 ft/min).
We must now calculate the distance the aircraft will cover in 10 minutes when flying at a GS of 180 kt: (180 kt x 10 min) ÷ 60 min = 30 NM
Since the aircraft should reach 2 000 ft at 10 NM from the airfield, it should start descent at a minimum distance of 40 NM (30 NM + 10 NM).

Options:
A. A
30 NM
B. C

A pilot is planning a flight for 4th of December 2019 and checks the NOTAMs for his/her destination aerodrome Hamburg (EDDH). What is the relevance of the following NOTAM for the time from 1315Z to 1625Z?
Q)EDWW/QGAAU/I/NBO/A/000/999/5338N00959E030
A)EDDH
B)1912041315
C)1912041625
E)EGNOS IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR LPV

Explanation:
Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) provide a high level of accuracy over a wide area (in contrast to GBAS, which provides accuracy to a small area), using satellites to send correction data to the aircraft. There are four systems under operation, which work on the same basic principle. One of them is the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS) in Western Europe and the Mediterranean.
EGNOS uses three geostationary INMARSAT (International Maritime Satellite Organisation) satellites, which broadcast GPS signals, provide horizontal accuracy of around 0.7 m and vertically around 1.1 m and it, also, alerts users within 6 seconds if a GPS malfunction occurs.
LPV is a 3D approach with vertical guidance (APV), like a conventional ILS, but using GNSS augmented by SBAS, with no barometric input.
According to the NOTAM, the EGNOS system, which is an SBAS system, is not available for LPV approaches, thus for LPV minima.

Options:
A. A
ABAS will NOT be available to aircraft on any approaches to Hamburg.
B. C
SBAS outage prevents 3D RNAV approaches to Hamburg.
C. D
ABAS will NOT be available at Hamburg to use LPV minima.
D. B
SBAS will NOT be available at Hamburg to use LPV minima. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00296
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

What is an LPV approach?

Explanation:
LPV stands for Localiser Performance with Vertical guidance and is defined as an Approach with Vertical Guidance. LPV is a subset of Area Navigation (RNAV) Approach minima that are available at some locations. Approaches to LPV minima have characteristics which are very similar to an ILS approach.
The fundamental difference between the two is the source of the guidance signals. Whilst an ILS is a ground-based approach, necessitating the associated transmitters and antennae for each individual runway, the source for RNAV LPV guidance is based on GNSS augmented by a space based facility, which can be used to simultaneously provide the guidance to an unlimited number of aircraft conducting concurrent approaches at multiple locations.

Options:
A. A
An approach with LNAV minima that is flown using the CDFA technique.
B. B
An approach with vertical guidance based only on BaroVNAV.
C. C
An approach with LNAV/VNAV minima in reference with ground based facility.
D. D
An approach with vertical guidance based on GNSS augmented by a space based facility. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00297
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to figure.
(For this question use VFR chart ED-4 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017). What is the True Course and distance for a direct flight from Scharnstein aerodrome (LOLC) (N47°54' E013°56') to Trieben aerodrome (LOGI) (N47°30' E014°30')?

Images:
- images/AT00297_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
For this question you need a plotter to both find the true track and measure the distance between Scharnstein (LOLC) and Trieben (LOGI) aerodrome .
Firstly, find the exact position of LOLC and LOGI aerodrome symbols on your Jeppesen ED-4 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points.
Center your plotter at the centre of the LOLC aerodrome symbol, since the question asks for the track from LOLC aerodrome.
Align the upper section of your plotter with the line which connects the two aerodromes.
Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North.
The aligned with the route LOLC to LOGI plotter’s arrow indicates the True Track 137o.
Furthermore, it is known that the ED-4 chart's scale is 1:500 000, as depicted in the frontal blue page of your GSPRM's ED-4 chart. For better accuracy, measure the distance between the centre of the two aerodrome symbols.
So, using the appropriate scale of your plotter (SECTIONAL 1:500 000), you will find that the distance between LOLC and LOGI is 33 NM.

Given the following information, what is the fuel mass?
Fuel volume: 670 Imperial gallons
Specific gravity: 0.78

Explanation:
A relationship exists between liters and kilograms: one litre of water weighs one kilogram.
A similar relationship exists between pounds or libres and imperial gallons: one IG of water weighs ten pounds or libres.
Specific Gravity (SG) is a measurement of the relative density: Mass of a given volume of fluid / Mass of an equal volume of water.
To convert fuel volumes we need to know that fuel is lighter than water. A volume of fuel in this question weighs 78% of the equivalent volume of water. That means that one IG of fuel weighs: 10 x 0.78 = 7.8 lbs.
Therefore, 670 IG weigh: 670 IG x 7.8 lbs = 5226 lb.

Options:
A. A
4358 lb
B. B

Complete line 3 for the sector WPT B to WPT C. What is the sector time from WPT B to WPT C and the accumulated time to DEST?

Images:
- images/AT00300_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
We must calculate the Ground Speed for the leg WTP B - WPT C:
TAS: 135 kt; W/V: 340/20; True Track: 270º
Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track.
Set wind direction to 340º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 135 kt.
Mark the wind velocity 20 kt down from the centre point.
Initially, set the True Track to 270º under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
Note that this heading would result in 8ºL drift and a track of 262º.
Reduce the heading value under the index until the heading minus the drift gives a track of 270º. This occurs at a heading of 278º with 8ºL drift.
The groundspeed for this track is approximately 127 kt.
Sector time from WPT B to WPT C:
Sector Time = Distance / Ground Speed
Sector Time = 53 NM / 127 kt = 25 min
Accumulated time to DEST:
Accumulated time until WPT B + Sector Time WPT B - WPT C + Sector Time WPT C - DEST = 23 min + 25 min + 4 min = 52 min

Explanation:
As stated in the question text, extra fuel is intended to cover for anticipated delays such as adverse weather or congested airspace en route.
Out of all of the answer options provided, the only justifiable reason for carrying extra fuel is due to the increased fuel consumption caused by an inoperative MEL (Minimum Equipment List) item, as this is something expected prior to the flight. The other options describe unforeseen events, meaning the crew could not have anticipated them and, therefore, could not have planned for extra fuel.

Options:
A. A
Unanticipated runway closure at the destination
B. C
Unexpected air traffic delays at the alternate airport
C. D
Unforeseen weather phenomena en route
D. B
Expected higher fuel consumption due to a known MEL item ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00303
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to CAP 697 figure 4.3.6. 
Given the following information, find the minimum required Alternate Fuel for an IFR Commercial Air Transport flight of duration 8 hours to a destination for which the operator has nominated two destination alternates ALTN1 and ALTN2. At the destination, meteorological information is available, weather conditions are expected to be above the planning minima within ETA +/- 1 hour, two runways are available and usable, the ceiling will be 1500 ft, and the ground visibility 4 km.
Distance to ALTN1: 200 NM
Wind to ALTN1: 50 kt HWC
Distance to ALTN2: 275 NM
Wind to ALTN2: 25 kt TWC
Landing Mass at alternates: 55.0 t

Images:
- images/AT00303_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
We must calculate the Alternate Fuel Required for both ALTN 1 and ALTN 2 and choose the lowest result:
(1) Fuel Required to ALTN 1: Represented by Red lines in the attached figure.
Start at the bottom of the graph at a Distance of 200 NM to the Alternate. Continue upwards until you reach the Wind Reference Line. From this point, continue diagonally up and to the right (following the reference lines), until you reach the 50 kt HDC "imaginary line". Now, continue vertically up until you reach the "Landing Weight at Alternate" reference line corresponding to 55 000 kg "55". Thereafter, continue horizontally to the right and read a result of 1900 kg Alternate Fuel.
(1) Fuel Required to ALTN 2: Represented by Green lines in the attached figure.
Start at the bottom of the graph at a Distance of 275 NM to the Alternate. Continue upwards until you reach the Wind Reference Line. From this point, continue diagonally down and to the left (following the reference lines), until you reach the 25 kt TWC "imaginary line". Now, continue vertically up until you reach the "Landing Weight at Alternate" reference line corresponding to 55 000 kg "55". Thereafter, continue horizontally to the right and read a result of 2100 kg Alternate Fuel.
The Lowest Alternate fuel is the 1900 kg (corresponding to ALTN 1)
Note: The question states that meteorological information is available and that weather conditions are expected to be above the planning minima. There's no legal reason to have 2 alternates. The operator has nominated 2 alternates, however that is not required by law in these circumstances. Therefore, in this case, you choose the one that requires less fuel.

Given the following information, the actual fuel consumption has…
Planned fuel at WPT B: 1222 kg
Actual fuel at WPT B: 1205 kg
Planned fuel at WPT C: 1178 kg
Actual fuel at WPT C: 1155 kg
Planned and Actual Sector Time from WPT B to WPT C: 5 minutes

Explanation:
Both the planned and actual sector time from WPT B to C is 5 mins or 0.0833 hours.
The planned fuel to be used from WPT B to C is 1222 kg - 1178 kg = 44 kg.
The planned fuel consumption is 44 kg / 0.0833 h = 528 kg/h
The actual fuel used from WPT B to C is 1205 kg - 1155 kg = 50 kg.
The actual fuel consumption is 50 kg / 0.0833 h = 600 kg/h
The actual fuel consumption is 600 - 528 = 72 kg/h more than planned.

Options:
A. A

You refuel with 220 IMP Gallons. What is the mass in Kg with a specific gravity of 0.82?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
There are two methods of solving this question:
(1) Converting IMP into litres and litres into kilograms:
Imperial Gallons to Litres (l) => Litres = Imp. Gal × 4.546
220 IMP x 4.546 = 1000.12 litres
Conversion between Fuel volume and mass: Fuel volume in litres x Specific Gravity (density) = Fuel Mass in Kg
1000.12 litres x 0.82 = 820 kg
(2) Use CRP5/Flight computer:
Align 220 IMP Gallong - using the INNER ring.
Look for the "KGS" scale, use the Specific Gravity of 0.82 on the outer ring and read 820 kg on the inner ring.

Refer to figure.
The annex shows an extract of the route info page on a typical operational flight produced by a flight planning tool.You are flying from GVAC to EGCC and notice there are three different distances shown on the flight plan. What is the significance of the difference between GND DIST and AIR DIST?

Images:
- images/AT00307_img_1.png

Explanation:
This Question gives 3 different distances (highlighted in red):
Ground Distance
Air Distance
Great Circle Distance
The Ground Distance is the expected total distance of the flight, included expected departure, cruise and arrival routings. (e.g. the actual planned route distance)
The Air Distance is the Ground Distance, modified by the expected winds to show how many miles are to be covered through the air (a headwind makes this value higher than the Ground Distance, whereas a tailwind will reduce it). It is calculated by the formula;
NAM/TAS = NGM/GS
where NAM is Nautical Air Miles and NGM is Nautical Ground Miles.
The Great Circle Distance (G/C DIST) is the direct distance from departure to destination aerodrome, following the great circle (shortest) track around the Earth.
In this question, the GND DIST is shorter than the AIR DIST, due to an average headwind of 30 kts.

Note: The difference in distance between the surface and cruising altitude due to radius of the great circle is almost negligible, so is not a factor.

Options:
A. A
The difference between GND DIST and AIR DIST is a measure of the difference in radius of the great circle at MSL and at cruising altitude.
B. B
AIR DIST is the distance actually flown by the aeroplane taking into account the expected departure, cruise, and arrival routings.
C. D
AIR DIST is the longest distance because it considers the altitude in addition to the route distance and shows the distance in three dimensions.
D. C
GND DIST is the actual planned route distance but it is shorter because there is an average headwind component for the flight. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00308
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Determine the revised estimated landing mass at the destination aerodrome, given the following information:
DOM: 9 950 Ib
Traffic Load: 3 450 Ib
Remaining Usable Fuel: 2 500 Ib
Remaining Trip Fuel to the destination: 1 200 Ib
Alternate Fuel: 525 Ib
Final Reserve Fuel: 415 Ib

Explanation:
Landing Mass (LM) is the mass of the aircraft on landing, i.e. the Take-off mass less the Trip fuel and it can be calculated with various methods depending on the data given.
Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM) is the total mass of the aircraft less the usable fuel.
The fuel mass at destination will be:
Remaining usable fuel - Remaining trip fuel to destination = 2 500 lb - 1 200 lb = 1 300 lb, including both Alternate and Final Reserve fuel.
Thus, the revised estimated landing mass at destination will be:
Fuel mass at destination + DOM + Traffic load = 1 300 lb + 9 950 lb + 3 450 lb = 14 700 lb
Alternatively:
The Zero Fuel Mass is:
DOM + Traffic load = 9 950 lb + 3 450 lb = 13 400 lb
The Fuel mass at destination will be:
Remaining usable fuel - Remaining trip fuel to destination = 2 500 lb - 1 200 lb = 1 300 lb, including both Alternate and Final Reserve fuel.
Thus, the revised estimated landing mass at destination will be: ZFM + Fuel mass at destination = 13 400 lb + 1 300 lb = 14 700 lb.
Please take note and exercise caution to prevent any instances of double mass calculations. This is important because certain masses are already encompassed within other mass calculations.

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Maximum allowable takeoff mass is the smaller of:
1- RTOM: 76000 kg
2- MLM + trip fuel: 66360 + 4761 = 71121 kg
According to graph we need to reduce the TOM to 68000 kg.
Extra fuel = TOM - (AZFM + Takeoff fuel)
Takeoff fuel = block fuel - taxi fuel = 8000 - 240 = 7760 kg
Extra fuel = 68000 - (59031 + 7760) = 1209 kg

Question Number: AT00312
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

What is an advantage of using GNSS FMC equipment in flight?

Explanation:
Learning Objective 033.02.01.07.08: Describe the advantages of global navigation satellite system/flight management computer (GNSS/FMC) equipment regarding: automatic calculation and display of tracks and leg distances; additional route information in the database (minimum altitudes, approach procedures); time and fuel estimates over waypoints; ability to adjust speed to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time; time and fuel revisions based on predicted and actual wind.
This is the closest available learning objective to this question, and even though none of the given options actually refer directly to the learning objective itself, it does give valuable guidance on which options to reject.
All modern transport aircraft will have Flight Management Computers (FMCs) fitted. Although the primary navigation input into the FMC comes from GNSS, it is usual for the FMC to compile and compare the GNSS position with other navigation systems, such as IRS, DME, VOR and even on some types, such as A380, with NDB. The GNSS stands for Global Navigation Satellite System.
FMCs contain two main databases, a navigation database and a performance one. The navigation database includes not only the position of navigation beacons, waypoints and airways, but also SIDs, STARs, approach procedures, runway lengths and minimum altitudes. The FMC will automatically calculate and display tracks and leg distances. It has also the ability to calculate speeds to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time, a selection known as RTA (Required Time of Arrival), as well as many other computational functions such as automatic fuel calculations.
The normal calculation method is for the FMC to use actual wind to the next waypoint and pilot-inputted forecast winds beyond that. The actual wind is calculated using FMS position and groundspeed, heading (provided by the IRS or AHRS), and TAS (provided by the Air Data Computer, which is an outside input).
The GNSS/FMC combination is not able to detect weather (that is down to the weather radar), nor does it ask for fewer data from the air data computer, as all the ADC data is still put to use within various onboard systems. Also, a route check before each flight is still essential, to check that the route has been inputted correctly by the pilot. There is no automatic route check, the FMC will happily fly any wrong route just as well as a correct one.
ETA is continuously updated using real-time GNSS data, which provides real-time positioning data that includes information about the aircraft's ground speed and track, enabling pilots to have accurate time-of-arrival estimates throughout the flight. Also when integrated with onboard weather systems or data from air traffic control, GNSS enables pilots to continuously monitor and account for actual wind conditions affecting the aircraft's flight path.
Therefore, the most correct answer would be to provide accurate ETA predictions and calculate the remaining fuel accurately.
Note: The feedback on this question is mixed; the question is believed to be almost exactly correct, but the options are not as precise. Any exam feedback on this question would therefore be greatly appreciated, and can be put in the comments or emailed to info@atplquestions.com.
Be sure to remember as much as you can of the above learning objective, so if you do get this question in your exam (it is quite common) and the options are not the same as we have here, you can choose the correct one more easily.

Options:
A. A
The aircraft systems require less data from the Air Data Computer.
B. B
There is NO need for a route check as this is an automatic function.
C. D
In-flight weather is more easily detected and avoided.
D. C
Updated wind to keep ETA prediction and remaining fuel calculation accurate. ✓ (CORRECT)

Correct Answer: D.

Question Number: AT00313
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

During a flight, a pilot decides to make an unplanned diversion due to passenger illness. The route to the alternate requires them to turn 90 degrees away from the planned track and fly for 50 nm. What altitude should the pilot choose to ensure a safe clearance from terrain and man-made structures?

Explanation:
There are a few ways of ensuring a safe altitude to fly at whilst IFR.
Around an aerodrome, you can use the MSA (minimum sector altitude) which goes out to 25nm from the aerodrome or a nearby nav-aid. These are documented on aerodrome charts.
On a pre-determined route, you can use the MEA (minimum en-route altitude) or the MOCA (minimum obstacle/obstruction clearance altitude), which are slightly different, but both provide sufficient terrain clearance (usually 5 nm either side of the route)
When close to a route, you can use that route's MORA (minimum off route altitude) which Jeppesen provide out to 10 nm from the route (useful for avoidance, offsets, etc.). Not enough for a 50 nm diversion away from the route.
Off a planned route completely, you can use the grid MORA from the en-route charts, which gives sufficient obstacle clearance with everything in that grid box.
All these give roughly the same obstacle clearance. Minimum 1000 ft everywhere, and minimum 2000 ft in "mountainous areas" where the terrain is higher than 5000 ft. There are small changes with some of them and in different countries, but this is the general rule.

Options:
A. B
GRID MORA only provides a clearance of 1000 ft in areas where the highest elevations are 5000 ft MSL or lower.
B. C
MORA, because it provides clearance over terrain and man-made structures on either side of the route centreline up to 2000 ft.
C. D
Minimum Off-Route Altitude (MORA).
D. A
Grid Minimum Off-Route Altitude (GRID MORA), because it provides clearance from terrain and man-made obstacles over a wider area. ✓ (CORRECT)

Refer to figure.
Determine the TAS if the aeroplane's weight is 67 500 kg and it is flying at FL370 with an OAT of -36° C:

Images:
- images/AT00314_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
In the column designated for FL370, locate the TAS values at both the 66 000 kg line (469 kt TAS) and the 68 000 kg line (461 kt TAS).
To determine the TAS at 67 500 kg, perform an interpolation, resulting in an approximate TAS of 463 kt:
66 000 kg 469 kt
67 500 kg (469 - 461) / 4 = 2 kt
for every 500 kg, the speed changes 2 kt:
461 kt + 2 kt = 463 kt
68 000 kg 461 kt

The OAT is disregarded since the table applies to ISA +20ºC, and FL370 is assumed to be above the tropopause, where the temperature is -56ºC.

Question Number: AT00315
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

With 3.5 hours’ total endurance on board, and a wind velocity of 270°/20 kt, a pilot has to travel over a distance of 200 NM on a track of 270°T.
If the TAS is 100 kt and the pilot must land with 30 minutes’ worth of fuel on board, what is the distance to the Point of Safe Return PSR, and how long will it take to get there

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The Point of Safe Return (PSR) is the last point on a route at which it is possible to return to the departure airfield arriving back with the required fuel reserves still available in the tanks. If the pilot chooses to continue past the PSR, he is now committed to landing at your destination.
Time (to PSR) = E x H / (0 + H)
Where, E = Safe endurance based on available fuel; H = Ground speed home; 0 = Ground speed out
Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track.
1. Set wind direction to 270º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
2. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 100 kt.
3. Mark the wind velocity 20 kt down from the centre point.
4. Initially, set the True Track under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
GS home: 090º
5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 120 kt.
GS out: 270º
5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 80 kt.
We can now apply the formulas:
Time (to PSR) = E x H / (0 + H)
Time to PSR = 3 x 120 / (80 + 120) = 1.8 h = 108 min
To find the distance from the departure airport to the PSR, we simply multiply the time to PSR by the GS OUT: 1.8 h × 80 kt = 144 NM.
Note: If the Pilot must land with 30 minutes of fuel remaining => our safe endurance will be total endurance - 30 min.

Determine the true altitude to make sure that the Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA) is maintained. Given:
MOCA: 3 950 ft
Cruising level: FL050
OAT: ISA-15ºC
QNH: 1 004 hPa
Aerodrome elevation: 1 340 ft

Explanation:
True Altitude = Indicated Altitude (standard pressure) + Pressure Correction + Temperature Correction
(1) Pressure Correction:
If QNH is higher than 1013 hPa => True Altitude is higher than Indicated Altitude.
If QNH is lower than 1013 hPa => True Altitude is lower than Indicated Altitude.
1013 – 1004 = 9 hPa
9 hPa x 30 ft = 270 ft
With regards to this question, QNH is 9 hPa lower than standard, therefore, True altitude is 9 hPa lower than Indicated altitude => 5 000 ft - 270 ft = 4 730 ft.
(2) Temperature Correction:
Rule of Thumb: correction of 4% for each 10º deviation from ISA (1% for each 2.5ºC)
If temperature is warmer than ISA => True Altitude is higher than IA.
If temperature is colder than ISA => True Altitude is lower than IA.
=> Temperature Error Correction is only applied above QFE Datum (Aerodrome Level) – Column of air between the aircraft and the meteo station.
The aircraft is 4 730 ft – 1 340 ft = 3 390 ft Above Aerodrome Level (AAL)
For ISA -15ºC, correction equals 6%:
3 390 ft x 6% = 203 ft
As ISA deviation is negative (-15ºC), True altitude is lower than Indicated altitude.
Therefore, True Altitude = Indicated altitude(QNH) - Temperature error correction
=> 4 730 ft - 203 ft = 4 527 ft

You plan a flight from Athens to Paris and back. Due to refueling problems in Paris, you decide to take fuel for the flight from Paris to Athens on the outbound leg, so that no fueling is necessary in Paris.
What do you expect?

Explanation:
Aviation is a very competitive market and each airline needs to minimise operating costs, in order to keep its ticket prices as competitive as possible. Fuel tankering is a practice whereby an aircraft carries more fuel than required for its next flight (trip fuel + reserve) in order to reduce or avoid refuelling at the destination airport. However, the additional fuel carried when doing fuel tankering increases the aircraft's weight and therefore increases its fuel consumption, resulting in additional CO2 emissions.
Fuel tankering provides financial savings mainly due to fuel price differences at airports. It is done in 90% of cases for fuel price reasons, and only in 10% of cases for social disruption, technical failures at the refuelling facility, fuel shortages, risks of delays, or contaminated fuel at destination airports. For fuel tankering to be economical the fuel price at the destination must be greater than the break even fuel price.
You may tanker fuel in case of/if: You will not tanker fuel if:
Adverse destination weather The cost of fuel is higher at the Departure than destination aerodrome
Fuel shortages at destination Low performance – not sufficient to clear MOCA with one engine inop
The cost of fuel at destination is higher than at the departure aerodrome Estimated landing mass at destination equals maximum landing mass

A flight crew is operating a Commercial Air Transport flight and arriving in VMC overhead the holding fix on the approach towards the destination airport A when ATC tells the Commander to take up the hold and expect 17 minutes delay. Use the data below for available fuel on board when commencing the hold and find the LEGAL and preferred COMMERCIAL solution.
Alternate Fuel: 40 minutes.
Final Reserve Fuel: 30 minutes.
Extra Fuel: 10 minutes.

Explanation:
There are two LEGAL options:
Divert immediately or,
As the destination is VMC, then an alternate is not required and the destination can be renominated as its own alternate.
Also, taking into account:
The cost of the aircraft landing at the alternate.
The subsequent additional costs of repositioning the aircraft.
The financial and reputational costs of the passengers/cargo not being delivered at the desired destination.
The preferred COMMERCIAL option is to land at the destination.
According to SPO.OP.150 "Destination alternate aerodromes — aeroplanes":
For IFR flights, the Pilot-In-Command shall specify at least one weather-permissible destination alternate aerodrome in the flight plan, unless:
(a) the available current meteorological information indicates that, for the period from 1 hour before until 1 hour after the estimated time of arrival, or from the actual time of departure to 1 hour after the estimated time of arrival, whichever is the shorter period, the approach and landing may be made under visual meteorological conditions (VMC); or
(b) the place of intended landing is isolated and:
(1) an instrument approach procedure is prescribed for the aerodrome of intended landing; and
(2) available current meteorological information indicates that the following meteorological conditions will exist from 2 hours before to 2 hours after the estimated time of arrival, or from the actual time of departure to 2 hours after the estimated time of arrival whichever is the shorter period:
(i) a cloud base of at least 300 m (1 000 ft) above the minimum associated with the instrument approach procedure; and
(ii) visibility of at least 5,5 km or of 4 km more than the minimum associated with the procedure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The LEGAL and preferred COMMERCIAL solution is option c) Hold 10 minutes to see effectively if it's a 17 minutes holding, and in case it is, proceed to the alternate, leaving the 30 minutes of final reserve fuel intact.
Option b) "Hold for 17 minutes, and after that time if landing isn't possible, proceed to alternate using the alternate fuel remaining." This scenario requires the pilots to consume 7 minutes of final reserve fuel, as they are only carrying 10 minutes of extra fuel (for holding).
Option a) "Immediately divert to the destination alternate since there is NOT sufficient fuel to hold for the estimated 17 minutes, thereby having extra fuel when landing at the destination alternate." is incorrect because diverting immediately to the alternate is not necessary since the aircraft has sufficient fuel to complete the hold and land at the destination airport A with the required fuel reserves.
Option d) "Declare minimum fuel to ATC as that will guarantee priority and ATC will ensure that the aeroplane will only hold for the available time to land with alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel." is incorrect because declaring minimum fuel is not necessary since the aircraft has sufficient fuel to complete the hold and land at the destination airport A with the required fuel reserves. Additionally, declaring minimum fuel when not actually necessary may cause unnecessary delays and concerns for the crew and ATC.

Options:
A. A
Hold for 17 minutes, and after that time if landing isn't possible, proceed to alternate using the alternate fuel remaining.
B. C
Declare minimum fuel to ATC as that will guarantee priority and ATC will ensure that the aeroplane will only hold for the available time to land with alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel.
C. D
Immediately divert to the destination alternate since there is NOT sufficient fuel to hold for the estimated 17 minutes, thereby having extra fuel when landing at the destination alternate.
D. B
Hold 10 minutes to see effectively if it's a 17 minutes holding, and in case it is, proceed to the alternate, leaving the 30 minutes of final reserve fuel intact. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00325
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A flight is planned over a distance of 360 NM. The TAS is 210 kt, the heading is 090° T, and the wind velocity is 090°/30 kt.
What is the distance to the Point of Equal Time PET and how long will it take to get there?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track.
1. Set wind direction to 090º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
2. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 210 kt.
3. Mark the wind velocity 30 kt down from the centre point.
4. Initially, set the True Track under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
GS home: 270º
5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 240 kt.
GS out: 090º
5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 180 kt.
We can now apply the formulas:
Distance to PET = (GS home x Distance) / (GS out + GS home)
Distance to PET = (240 x 360) / (180 + 240)
Distance to PET = 206 NM
Time to PET = Distance to PET / GS out
Time to PET = 206 NM / 180 kt = 1.144 hrs (x60 to get minutes) = 68.67 min = approx. 69 min

Question Number: AT00328
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

You are planning a flight for 4th of December 2019 and checks the NOTAMs for his/her destination aerodrome Brussels (EBBR). What is the effect of the following NOTAM for the time of arrival 18:00 UTC?
Q)EDWW/QGAAU/I/NBO/A/000/999/5338N00959E030
A)EBBR
B)1912041845
C)1912042045
E)EGNOS IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR LPV

Explanation:
Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) provide a high level of accuracy over a wide area (in contrast to GBAS, which provides accuracy to a small area), using satellites to send correction data to the aircraft. There are four systems under operation, which work on the same basic principle. One of them is the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS) in Western Europe and the Mediterranean.
EGNOS uses three geostationary INMARSAT (International Maritime Satellite Organisation) satellites, which broadcast GPS signals, provide horizontal accuracy of around 0.7 m and vertically around 1.1 m and it, also, alerts users within 6 seconds if a GPS malfunction occurs.
LPV is a 3D approach with vertical guidance (APV), like a conventional ILS, but using GNSS augmented by SBAS, with no barometric input.
According to the NOTAM, the EGNOS system, which is an SBAS system, is not available only between 18:45 UTC and 20:45 UTC. Therefore, you are not affected at 18:00 UTC, the Arrival time.

Options:
A. A
SBAS will not be available at Hamburg to use LPV minima.
B. B
You can not execute 3D RNAV approaches to Hamburg due to the SBAS outage.
C. C
ABAS will be unavailable for all approaches.

Refer to ALICANTE - Chart 10-3A from Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
Your departure is via CATON 3A and you are cleared to FL80. Due to a restriction you have to remain at 2 000 ft until passing VOR/DME ALT. QNH is 1040 hPa, ROC is 800 ft/min and GS is 133 kts. When are you going to reach the top of climb (ToC)?

Images:
- images/AT00329_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft is are cleared to FL80. However, the pilot must maintain 2 000 ft (QNH set) until passing ALT VOR.
Altitude Correction = 1 040 - 1 013 = 27 hpa = 27 x 30 = 810 ft
Pressure altitude = 2 000 - 810 = 1 190 ft
The aircraft must climb from approx. 1 200 ft to 8 000 ft = 6 800 ft at a ROC of 800 ft/min.
Climb time = 6 800 / 800 = 8.5 minutes.
Ground distance = (8.5 / 60) x 133 = 18.8 NM (approx. 19 NM
The aircraft will reach its Cruising altitude 19 NM after starting the climb at ALT VOR.
Distance from VOR to VILNA = 20 NM

Given the following information, at what time will the PET be reached?
Leg distance: 1000 NM
Leg track: 090°
TAS: 200 kt
Wind: 090°/20 kt
Departure time: 12:00

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Solving from Heading (HDG) & Ground Speed (GS), knowing WV, TAS and required track.
1. Set wind direction to 090º under the "TRUE HEADING" index at the top.
2. Set the center point on the True Airspeed (TAS) of 200 kt.
3. Mark the wind velocity 20 kt down from the centre point.
4. Initially, set the True Track under the "TRUE HEADING" index.
GS home: 270º
5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 220 kt.
GS out: 090º
5. The groundspeed for this track is approximately 180 kt.
We can now apply the formulas:
Distance to PET = (GS home x Distance) / (GS out + GS home)
Distance to PET = (220 x 1000) / (180 + 220)
Distance to PET = 550 NM
Time to PET = Distance to PET / GS out
Time to PET = 550 / 180 = 3 h 3 min
PET will be reached at:
Departure time + Time to PET = 12 h + 3 h 3 = 15 h 3

Refer to figure.
An extract from a typical flight plan produced by an airline flight planning tool. Assume that the fuel flow remains the same as experienced between OKEPI and OKIRA and that the actual times between the waypoints are as planned. What is the estimated remaining fuel overhead MOKIP?

Images:
- images/AT00333_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
For this question, to find the remaining fuel overhead MOKIP, the actual fuel flow is required and can be found using the actual data from OKEPI to OKIRA:
The actual flight time from OKEPI to OKIRA is: 17:59 - 17:58 = 1 min and it burns: 5990 kg - 5950 kg = 40 kg.
Thus, the aircraft's fuel flow is: 40 kg/min.
The flight time from OKIRA to MOKIP is: 2 min + 2 min+ 6 min = 10 min. So, the fuel required from OKIRA to MOKIP will be: 10 min x 40 kg/min = 400 kg.
Therefore, the remaining fuel overhead MOKIP will be: Remaining fuel overhead OKIRA - Fuel required from OKIRA to MOKIP = 5 950 kg - 400 kg = 5 550 kg.

Question Number: AT00334
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

You are flying at FL80 over a hilly area with the highest obstacle at 5600 ft. The QNH at a nearby aerodrome (elevation 2000 ft) is 1003 hPa, and the temperature is ISA -11°C. Considering the Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA), is your vertical separation from the obstacle sufficient?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA) is the lowest published altitude in effect between radio fixes on VOR airways, off-airways routes, or route segments, which meet obstacle clearance requirements for the entire route segment. Normally, this gives 1000 ft clearance over obstacles up to and including 6000 ft and 2000 ft clearance for obstacles over 6000 ft in elevation. It is indicated on an en-route charts with a "T" suffix.
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 1003 hPa = 10 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 10 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­300 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude = 8000 ft - 300 ft = 7700 ft.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -11ºC. For temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 7700 ft - 2000 ft = 5700 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-11) × (5700/1000) = 251 ft.
The temperature correction is subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 7700 ft - 251 ft = 7449 ft.
Thus, the height of the aircraft above the obstacle will be: True Altitude - obstacle elevation = 7449 ft - 5600 ft = 1849 ft, thus obstacle clearance can be ensured.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate (if not provided by the question).
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4%-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = _____ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF THEN
Higher pressure Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
DEFINITIONS.
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.
Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.
True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.

Explanation Images:
- images/explanation_AT00334_img_1.png

Options:
A. A
No, because the corrected true altitude provides only about 1672 ft of clearance.
B. B
Yes, because FL80 corresponds to approximately 8000 ft regardless of temperature.
C. C
No, because the pressure and temperature corrections reduce your altitude below the obstacle height.
D. D
Yes, because the obstacle clearance is more than 1000 ft. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00335
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

A performance class B aircraft is planning to depart for an isolated destination aerodrome as a Commercial Air Transport operation. Calculate the minimum amount of fuel (to the nearest 10 kg) required when overhead the Isolated aerodrome, considering the following details.
Flight time: 2 hours and 45 minutes
Top of climb to top of descent time: 2 hours
Normal fuel consumption at cruise: 540 kg per hour

Explanation:
According to AMC7 CAT.OP.MPA.182 Fuel/energy scheme — aerodrome selection policy — aeroplanes:
Unless destination alternate fuel is carried, the operator should use a destination aerodrome as an isolated aerodrome if the alternate fuel plus the FRF that is required to reach the nearest adequate destination alternate aerodrome is more than for aeroplanes with reciprocating engines, the amount of fuel required to fly:
either for 45 minutes plus 15 % of the flying time planned for cruising, including FRF, or
2 hours, whichever is lower.
1) Fuel to fly for 45 minutes plus 15% of the planned flight time at cruising level is:
45 min at 540 kg/hr: 45/60 hr x 540 kg/hr = 405 kg
15% of 2 hours cruise with 540 kg/hr: 15% x (2 hr x 540 kg/hr) = 162 kg
Totally, 405 kg + 162 kg = 567 kg, rounded to nearest 10 kg, becomes 570 kg.
2) And, fuel to fly for 2 hours is: 2 hr x 540 kg/hr = 1080 kg.
Therefore, the minimum amount of fuel required when overhead the Isolated aerodrome is the lower between 1) and 2), 570 kg.

- images/AT00336_img_2.png
- images/AT00336_img_3.png
- images/AT00336_img_4.png

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) is a route on an instrument approach procedure by which an aeroplane may proceed from the en-route phase of its flight to the Initial Approach Fix (IAF), after which an approach procedure is normally followed.
Initial Approach Fix (IAF) is a fix that marks the beginning of the initial approach segment and the end of the arrival segment (STAR), if applicable, i.e. it is a common fix point for both a STAR and an Approach procedure.
According to ALICANTE 10-2G chart, both CALLES 1R (CLS1R) and VALENCIA 1R (VLC1R) STAR procedures end at a common compulsory waypoint, BESOR (IAF), which is also the IAF for the VOR X and VOR Z approach procedures.
Looking at the three VOR approach charts, you will figure out that only two of them, ALICANTE 13-3 and ALICANTE 13-5 approach charts, include BESOR waypoint as IAF of the approach procedures depicted.

Question Number: AT00338
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

What is the difference between an RNAV STAR and RNAV STAR overlay?

Explanation:
Area Navigation (RNAV) is defined as a method of navigation which permitts aircraft operation on any desired flight path within the coverage of station-referenced navigation aids or within the limits of the capability of self-contained aids, or a combination of these. In simple words, the ability to fly from point to point, rather than following VOR radials or NDB bearings.
The conventional Standard Arrival Route procedures (STARs) use ground navigational aids, while the RNAV STARs use Fly-by and Fly-over waypoints and are followed by the FMS.
RNAV equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satellite systems, inertial systems or combinations of these.
Aircraft equipped with RNAV systems, which have been approved by the State of the Operator for the appropriate level of RNAV operations, may use these systems to carry out VOR/DME RNAV approaches and departures.
An RNAV STAR overlay is a traditional STAR that allows pilots to use GPS equipment to fly existing, conventional instrument STAR procedures. However, many of these overlays may not accurately reflect the correct STAR procedure and may even represent a different speed category of aircraft. The normal equipment for that RNAV STAR must always be used as the primary reference – and not the GPS - as it allows for efficient sequencing of the traffic flow, thus reducing the workload of the ATC. Otherwise, any disparity between the displays and the potential for mistakes are just as likely to diminish the safety margins.

Options:
A. A
The RNAV STAR is designed to replace the conventional navigation systems routing.
B. B
The RNAV STAR overlay is a shorter route than the RNAV STAR.
C. D
The RNAV STAR overlay is a longer route than the RNAV STAR.
D. C
The RNAV STAR allows for efficient sequencing of the traffic flow, thus reducing the workload of the ATC. ✓ (CORRECT)

(Refer to the attached figure from CAP 697, Figure 4.5.3.2 Mach 0.74 Cruise PA 35 000 ft).
An aeroplane is flying at FL350, where the OAT is -40°C. What is the TAS if the aeroplane’s gross weight is 60 200 kg?

Images:
- images/AT00339_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
(1) Read TAS from the table:
Given the conditions - Mach 0.74 Cruise PA 35 000 ft, we have a TAS value of 426 kt.
HOWEVER, read the note at the bottom of the table:
"NOTE 2: INCREASE TAS BY 1 KNOT PER DEGREE C ABOVE ISA"
(2) Calculate ISA Deviation:
ISA temperature at 35 000 ft = 15 - 2 x 35 = -55°C
Actual temperature = -40°C
Therefore, ISA dev = +15°C
(3) Calculate TAS:
426 kt + 15 kt = 441 kt

Refer to figure.
To avoid a turbulent area you request ATC for clearance to climb to FL210. When you reach over WPT B you are maintaining FL210 with CAS of 160. What is the revised ETA at WPT C?

Images:
- images/AT00340_img_1.png

Explanation:
To find TAS at FL210:
In the Airspeed Correction window, align the pressure altitude 21000 ft with the OAT at FL210 -25° C.
Opposite CAS 160 kt (16) in the inner scale, read TAS 223 kt (23) on the outer scale.
To find GS from B to C:
Set wind direction 190° (from B to C at FL210) under the True Index.
Mark wind velocity 5 kt up from the centre point.
Set the true course 335° (from B to C) under the True Index.
Slide wind velocity mark to TAS 223 kt.
Ground speed 227 kt reads under centre.
Thus, with GS 227 kt at FL210, the aircraft will cover the sector distance from B to C 61 NM in: Sector Time = Sector distance / GS = 61 NM / 227 kt = 0.27 hr or 16.1min.
Therefore, the revised ETA at C will be 12:12 (ATA at B) + 16.1 = 12:28.

Question Number: AT00342
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

The following Instrument Approach Operations are classified as 3D Approach Operations:
1. RNP APCH (GNSS and baro VNAV)
2. GLS
3. PAR
4. RNP 1
5. ILS
6. RNP APCH (SBAS)

Explanation:
3D APPROACHES
Three dimensional approaches use both lateral and vertical guidance, with the vertical prole provided by the guidance system. A decision altitude (DA) minimum procedure is used.
There are several types of RNP APCH with 3D vertical guidance, and they differ in the way in which they source their vertical guidance information.
RNP APCH introduced new types of 3D operations, making use of certified Baro-VNAV systems or the SBAS geometric positioning (RNP APCH to LNAV/VNAV and to LPV respectively);
GNSS + VNAV is a PBN 3D approach: GNSS nav in the horizontal plane and barometric inputs for the vertical plane;
SBAS with vertical guidance (LPV): supported by Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) such as EGNOS in Europe and WAAS in the US to provide lateral and vertical guidance.
Instrument landing systems (ILS), Precision Approach Radar (PAR), and ground-based GNSS augmentation landing systems (GLS) are 3D approaches, which work independently from PBN.
RNP1 is a form of RNAV navigation specification (for arrival, initial, intermediate and missed approach segments).

Refer to VFR chart ED-4 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017. You are planning a VFR flight from Blaubeuren (EDMC) (N48°25' E009°48') to Albstadt (EDSA) (N48°16' E009°04'). The magnetic track for the flight is (1)___ and the distance between the aerodromes is (2)___.

Images:
- images/AT00347_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
For this question you need a plotter to both find the true track and measure the distance between Blaubeuren (EDMC) and Albstadt (EDSA).
Calculate Magnetic Track:
Firstly, find the exact position of EDMC and EDSA aerodrome symbols on your Jeppesen ED-4 chart, using the coordinates given and draw a line with your pencil to connect these two points.
Center your plotter at EDMC aerodrome symbol, since the question asks for the track from EDMC aerodrome.
Align the upper section of your plotter with the line which connects the two aerodromes.
Rotate the plotter’s disc, until its arrows are parallel with the chart’s meridians and indicate the True North.
The aligned with the route EDMC to EDSA plotter’s arrow indicates the True Track 251°.
The two aerodromes are close to the 2°E isogonal.
Thus, following the rhyme "Variation East, Magnetic least", the magnetic track is: 251°T - 2°E = 249°M
Calculate Distance:
It is known that the ED-4 chart's scale is 1:500 000, as depicted in the frontal blue page of your GSPRM's ED-4 chart.
So, using the appropriate scale of your plotter (SECTIONAL 1:500 000), you will find that the distance between EDMC and EDSA is 31 NM.

Question Number: AT00348
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to VFR chart ED-4 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
Considering the following scenario, select the correct statement. In the Item 8 "FLIGHT RULES" the letter "Z" has been inserted in an ATC flight plan of a VFR departure from the Lahr aerodrome (EDTL, N48 22’ E07 50’). Enroute to the compulsory VFR reporting point "ECHO" in VMC conditions , the pilot requests IFR clearance. The ATC controller verifies the departing aircraft's transponder code, confirms a positive radar identification and provides the IFR clearance with further instructions, with the aircraft still being in VMC at 1500 ft AGL.

Images:
- images/AT00348_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
In Item 8 "FLIGHT RULES" the pilot should insert one of the letters: I, V, Y, Z to denote the category of flight rules with which the pilot intends to comply:
I: If it is intended that the entire flight will be operated under the IFR.
V: If it is intended that the entire flight will be operated under the VFR.
Y: If the flight initially will be operated under the IFR, followed by one or more subsequent changes of flight rules.
Z: If the flight initially will be operated under VFR, followed by one or more subsequent changes of flight rules. (The ATC flight plan should have been filled with the letter I (for IFR) in item 8-INCORRECT)
After the aircraft's departure from the Lahr aerodrome towards ECHO reporting point, when the aircraft is provided with the IFR clearance being at 1500 ft AGL, it is within a controlled airspace Class D with an upper vertical limit at 2500 ft AGL. Approaching at ECHO reporting point, the aircraft enters in a Class E uncontrolled airspace with a lower vertical limit at 1000 ft AGL. (IFR flights are allowed inside class E airspace and they are subject to an ATC clearance.) (IFR flight inside class E airspace is NOT allowed-INCORRECT)
When flying in accordance with an ATC clearance inside or outside controlled airspace in IFR, the Pilot-In-Command is not relieved of the basic responsibility for ensuring the safety of the aircraft, including terrain avoidance, but he/she is responsible for terrain separation in flight at all times, unless under vectors by radar, where the Radar Controller will issue clearances such that the required obstacle clearance will exist at all times. (In VMC conditions while flying IFR inside controlled airspace the Pilot-in-Command is solely responsible for terrain separation-INCORRECT because not responsible for situations in which he/she is being vectored.)
When issuing an IFR clearance inside controlled airspace, the ATC controller is responsible for providing terrain separation, however the PIC can decline the clearance to fly below MSA if the temperature is lower-CORRECT Although this is the most correct option among the options, it is not entirely correct. The ATC is responsible for safe terrain separation, only when providing radar vectors. Even when the ATC controller provides altitude clearances, the PIC can deny them if they believe they are unsafe, for example if separation is reduced due to temperatures colder than ISA.
NOTE: There is not enough information on this question, and in fact none of the answers are what we would consider to be fully correct. Recent feedback has confirmed the correct option is the one marked. If you see this question in the exam in this way, you can appeal it. Please let us know in the comments if you see this question in an exam and any information you have about it. Alternatively, feedback can be sent to info@atplquestions.com, thank you.

Question Number: AT00351
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft is flying at FL50, where the OAT is ISA +10°C. The QNH given by a meteorological station with an elevation of 1 000 ft AMSL is 990 hPa. Calculate the approximate true altitude of the aircraft. (Assume 1 hPa = 30 ft)

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
In this question, we are given a pressure altitude (in the form of a flight level) and are asked for the terrain clearance, therefore we need to determine the corresponding true altitude.
The first step is to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1013 hPa - 990 hPa = 23 hPa. The question provides a barometric lapse rate near the surface of 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 23 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = ­­­690 ft. This value needs to be subtracted to the pressure altitude as per the rules below:
Indicated altitude = 5 000 ft - 690 ft = 4 310 ft.
Next, we need to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA +10ºC. For temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 4 310 ft - 1 000 ft = 3 310 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (+10) × (3 310/1000) = 132 ft.
The temperature correction is added to the indicated altitude as per the rules below, to give a true altitude of 4 310 ft + 132 ft = 4 442 ft
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.
Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.
True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.

Question Number: AT00352
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

An aircraft is flying under IFR using its FMS for area navigation and intends to enter a controlled airspace via waypoint OSLEL. The aircraft is cleared to approach OSLEL at 1346Z. The current Estimated Time Overhead (ETO) OSLEL is 1343Z and the pilot decreases the groundspeed accordingly. What is the appropriate way of checking that the new speed is suitable to arrive overhead OSLEL at 1346Z?

Explanation:
The FMC contains two main databases:
The navigation database, which among others includes the position of beacons, waypoints and airways.
The performance database, which is able to calculate maximum and optimum cruise altitudes, optimum speeds for climb, cruise and descent and the required thrust settings for each phase of flight.
The FMC has the ability to calculate speeds to arrive over a waypoint at a defined time, a selection known as Required Time of Arrival (RTA). Using the two databases in combination, the FMC will give running estimates of time and fuel remaining over waypoints and at destination.
For this question, the Estimated Time Overhead (ETO) OSLEL prediction is calculated based on groundspeed and distance from the active waypoint, so the FMS will calculate a new ETO with the new groundspeed and distance to go, which can be checked against the time in the clearance.

Options:
A. B
The FMS will give the crew a distance and groundspeed, which can be used to calculate ETO at OSLEL to check against the clearance.
B. C
The FMS will give the crew groundspeed, and the change in groundspeed can be used to adjust the ETO at OSLEL.
C. D
The FMS will give the crew a time to run to OSLEL, from which they can confirm the ETO is correct.
D. A
The FMS will give the crew a new ETO at OSLEL, which can be checked against the time in the clearance. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00354
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to figure or Chart E(LO)6 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017.
You are planning to fly from CARBONARA VOR (N39°07' E009°30') to AJACCIO VOR (N41°46' E008°46') using an RNAV ATS route, which is the shortest route to fly?

Images:
- images/AT00354_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Examine each route carefully:
The RNAV ATS route CAR - M732 - ALG- L5 - POZZO - J19 - AJO is 213 NM.
CAR => ALG = 108 NM(*)
ALG => POZZO = 30 NM + 20 NM = 50 NM
POZZO => AJO = 26 NM + 29 NM = 55 NM

The RNAV ATS route CAR - M732 - RAMEN - M858 - MINKA - P872 - AJO is 173 NM. However, M858 is a CDR 3 route from Ramen to MINKA and only assigned by ATC.
CAR => RAMEN = 38 NM + 11 NM = 49 NM
RAMEN => MINKA = 28 NM + 33 NM = 61 NM
MINKA => AJO = 33 NM + 30 NM = 63 NM

The RNAV ATS route CAR - M732 - ALG - L42 - AJO is 181 NM.
CAR => ALG = 108 NM(*)
ALG => AJO = 73 NM

The RNAV ATS route CAR - M732 - ALG - L978 - OBOBO - AJO is 199 NM.
CAR => ALG = 108 NM(*)
ALG => OBOBO = 75 NM
OBOBO => AJO = 16 NM
Therefore, the shortest route to fly from CARBONARA (CAR) VOR (N39º07', E009º30') to AJACCIO (AJO) VOR (N41°46' E008°46') using an RNAV ATS route, is: CAR - M732 - ALG - L42 - AJO.
(*) CAR => ALG = 38 NM + 11 NM + 14 NM + 20 NM + 12 NM + 13 NM = 108 NM

Refer to figure or to chart ED-4 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017 .
As you approach Linz Airport from the North, what is the best visual aid to use just before entering the Linz TMA?

Images:
- images/AT00355_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
In this case, the best option for visual aids is to use the lighted mast (3 549 ft) just North of the TMA boundary, as it will be quite visible, but also almost directly North of Linz airfield and is a good reference point to tell you where the TMA will begin.
The other options are not as good:
LOLE airport is a good visual reference point but to the North-West of Linz airport, so not a good reference point when approaching from the North.
Friestadt VOR is an excellent aid for flying this route IFR, but visually, the ground equipment for a VOR is small and sometimes difficult to spot.
The high ground (2 392 ft) is North-East of Linz and would likely blend in with other relatively high terrain nearby, so would not be a good visual reference point in any case.

Question Number: AT00356
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Which one of the following is a type B approach?
1. GNSS 3D with GBAS.
2. GNSS 3D with ABAS only.
3. GNSS LNAV with GBAS.
4. GNSS LNAV with ABAS only.

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
According to ICAO Annex 6, Annex 10 and Annex 14, there are two types of classification for approach operations, dependent upon the achieved minima at the end of the approach:
Type A: may be either 2D or 3D operations; 2D will only have a lateral path defined for the approach operation where 3D will have both a lateral and vertical path defined for that operation. A Type A operation will permit aircraft operations down to a minimum height or altitude of 250 ft. All NPAs and Approcahes with Vertical guidance (APV) using Barometric altimetry are Type A approach operations.
Type B: are 3D operations; a lateral and vertical path is defined and guidance along this path is provided either from GNSS augmented with SBAS (APV SBAS) or GBAS, or by a precision approach system (ILS, MLS).

Question Number: AT00357
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Refer to figure.
The figure shows a typical fuel plan for a Commercial Air Transport flight with operational impact factors as produced by a flight planning tool. Since the aeroplane has arrived late, it is planned to fly the next flight at a higher speed. Use the data below to calculate the revised flight time.
Revised speed: M 0.80
Revised weight: 1500 Kg up
Cruising Altitude: Planned Flight Level.

Images:
- images/AT00357_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
According to the data in the figure, the planned trip requires 14 636 kg fuel and 5 hr 5 min (0505) flight time.
In this question, the speed is increased to M08.0 and the weight by 1500 kgs:
According to the operational impact factors at the bottom section of the fuel plan, the increased weight increases the Trip fuel by 140 kg per 1000 kg increase in aircraft weight, but there is no increase in flight time because of the increased weight.
Whilst, the increased speed to M 08.0 results in an increase in fuel of 639 Kg and a decrease in flight time by 6 minutes.
Therefore, the Revised Flight Time will be:
Planned flight Time -Correction due to increased speed = 05:05 - 6 min = 4 hours 59 minutes.

Refer to figure.
A pilot requests ATC clearance to climb to FL210 to avoid a turbulent area when approaching waypoint B. When you reach overhead waypoint B, the pilot maintains FL210 with CAS of 160 kt. What will be the revised ETA at WPT C?

Images:
- images/AT00359_img_1.png

Explanation:
Refer to figures.
For this question your Flight/Navigation computer is required to find both True airspeed and Groundspeed at the desired altitude FL210.
Find TAS at FL210:
In the Airspeed Correction window, align the pressure altitude 21 000 ft with the OAT at FL210 -25°C.
Opposite CAS 160 kt (16) in inner scale, read TAS 224 kt on outer scale.
Find Groundspeed from B to C:
Set wind direction 190° (from B to C at FL210) under the True index.
Mark wind velocity 65 kt up from centre point.
Set the true course 335° (from B to C) under the True index.
Slide wind velocity mark to TAS 224 kt.
Ground speed 274 kt reads under centre.
Thus, with GS 274 kt at FL210, the aircraft will cover the sector distance from B to C (61 NM) in: Revised Time from B to C = Sector distance / GS = 61 NM / 274 kt = 0.22 hr or 13 min.
Therefore, the revised time at Waypoint C will be: Actual time at B + Revised time from B to C = 12:12 + 13 min = 12:25.

Which is a correct statement with reference to an RNAV SID?

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
Area navigation (RNAV) routes utilize aircraft RNAV equipment for navigation guidance.
RNAV SID is an instrument departure route which relies on aircraft area navigation equipment for navigation guidance and can be flown without ground based aids.
RNAV SIDs and STARs offer accuracy based on distance rather than angular limitation, unlike conventional SIDs and STARs. This feature aids in organizing traffic, particularly in busy or confined airspaces.

Images:
- images/AT00361_img_1.png
- images/AT00361_img_2.png

Explanation:
This question looks quite complex but it is, in fact, quite simple. You can, however, opt to draw each of the situations described in the given options. But this is definitely not necessary and will take up a lot of time. Just take a careful look at the values and note that:
OAT from ISA to ISA + 20° C will increase fuel consumption by 1.2 %
Headwind from 0 to 30 kt will slow us down with ISA + 5° C (increase fuel consumption by 0.3 %). Our new TAS will 429 and GS will be 399. Therefore trip time will increase about 429 / 399 = 1.07 times. Which will be proportional to fuel consumption.
Option with the same 30 kt headwind and lower than ISA temp. is definitely consume less fuel than the previous one as at lower than ISA temperatures less fuel consumed.
Finally about 50 kt headwind option our TAS will be 424 and GS will be 374. Trip time increase is 424 / 374 = 1.13 Therefore assuming the same fuel flow clearly this one will cause greatest increase in trip fuel required.

Options:
A. A
headwind component from 0 kt to 30 kt plus a change in OAT from ISA to ISA + 5°C.
B. C
headwind component from 0 kt to 30 kt plus a change in OAT from ISA to ISA -10° C.
C. D
OAT from ISA to ISA + 20° C.
D. B
headwind component from 0 kt to 50 kt. ✓ (CORRECT)

Question Number: AT00362
Subject: ATPL(A) (EASA 2020) | 033 - Flight Planning Monitoring

Determine the lowest usable flight level for an IFR flight provided that the MOCA is 3 300 ft and the transition altitude is 3 000 ft, given:
QNH: 1020 hPa
Temperature: -7°C
The airport elevation is: 27 ft
Magnetic course: 182°
Variation: 8°E

Explanation:
Refer to figure.
The aircraft must fly at 3 300 ft (MOCA). This altitude must be the true altitude of the aircraft. This altitude must be corrected for any temperature ISA deviation and then any difference in pressure from standard (1013 hPa), to get the pressure altitude, allowing us to work out the lowest usable flight level.
To compute the temperature correction, it is necessary to have knowledge of the ISA air temperature. In the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), the air temperature at sea level is 15ºC, and the temperature lapse rate is -2ºC/1 000 ft. The formula to calculate the ISA temperature is: ISA temperature = 15ºC - (27/1 000) x 2, giving an ISA temperature of approx. 15ºC. The actual temperature is ­­­-7ºC, which is an ISA deviation of ISA -22ºC.
The first step is to determine the temperature correction. The ISA deviation is ISA -22ºC. For the temperature correction, the airfield elevation must be taken into account: 3 300 ft - 27 ft = 3 273 ft. Based on the 4% rule and its calculation mentioned in the rules below, the height correction for the temperature can be calculated as follows: Height correction for temperature = 4 × (-22) × (3 273/1 000) = 288 ft.
In this case, the temperature correction is added to the true altitude as per the rules below (refer to the table below), to give an indicated altitude of 3 588 ft.
Next, we need to compute the pressure correction by considering the deviation from the standard mean sea level pressure of 1013 hPa: 1020 hPa - 1013 hPa = 7 hPa. Since the barometric lapse rate near the surface is 30 ft/hPa, the pressure correction can be calculated as follows: Pressure correction = 7 hPa x 30 ft/hPa = 210 ft. This value needs to be subtracted from the indicated altitude as per the rules below:
Pressure Altitude = 3 588 ft - 210 ft = 3 378 ft.

According to the ICAO IFR Semi-Circular Rule, below FL290:
For Easterly magnetic tracks (000° - 179°), select ODD FLs (FL110, FL130, etc.)
For Westerly magnetic tracks (180° - 359°), select EVEN FLs (FL100, FL120, etc.)
The aircraft flies a south magnetic track of 182º(M). Thus, the Minimum Flight Level, which provides obstacle clearance, after both pressure and temperature correction, that must be selected is: FL40.
RULES. The following rules should be considered for altimetry calculations:
All calculations are based on rounded pressure values to the nearest lower hPa.
The value for the barometric lapse rate between MSL and 500 hPa to be used is 30 ft/hPa as an acceptable approximation of the barometric lapse rate.
To determine the true altitude/height, the following rule of thumb, called the ‘4 %-rule’, shall be used: the altitude/height changes by 4% for each 10°C temperature deviation from ISA.
For simplification: Height correction for the temp = 4 × (ISA DEV) × Indicated alt/1000 = ___ ft
If no further information is given, the deviation of the outside-air temperature from ISA is considered to be the same throughout the whole layer.
The elevation of the aerodrome has to be taken into account. The temperature correction has to be considered for the layer between the station (usually an aerodrome) and the position of the aircraft.
IF
THEN
Higher pressure
Indicated Altitude > Pressure Altitude
Lower pressure
Indicated Altitude < Pressure Altitude
Warmer than ISA
True Altitude > Indicated Altitude
Colder than ISA
True Altitude < Indicated Altitude
Definitions
Pressure Altitude: The altimeter indication with standard pressure (1013.2 hPa) set.
Indicated Altitude: The altimeter indication with local QNH set.
True altitude: The actual altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level.
